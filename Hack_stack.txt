FIXED:
	Upper-level text is shown when editing "down in-place" (for JonG)

Dima ID: 146861 department: 562-363-4073 (under Greg)

Things to do:
	The whole "Copy Subcells" issue (also, it leaves cross-library references in place)
	Multipage Schematics:
		Multiple exports with the same name on different pages?
		Multiple cell-centers?
		Adjust coordinate space?
		Fix EDIF to use it
	Mimic stitcher doesn't preview arcs to be created
	Things that aren't undoable (and don't mark the library "dirty"):
		Negating arcs
		Setting a cell's technology
	Ability to click and drag a cell from the Explorer window to create an instance
		(ExplorerTree.dragGestureRecognized() starts the action)
	Waveform window:
		Instead of using zoom tool, double-click on an axis or something to manually enter the limits (for Justin)
		Ability to "export PostScript" (for Justin)
		Why does cursor change to zoom mode automatically after plotting signal from list (for Ian)
		List HSpice exports at the lower level, not the upper level (for Ian)
		Reload button doesn't update signals panel on left (for Justin)
		Have "Measure" mode cross panel boundaries (for Robert)
 		Why does VCR control have trouble stopping?
		On Mac, dragging signal names from the explorer list drags a box the size of the explorer window (RD-103)
		If you add some signals, close the viewer, open it, add some more
			signals, close it and restarts, often the second set of signals that you
			add are not remembered (JonL)
		Want horizontal grid lines (JonL)
 	Simulation:
		Verilog output doesn't handle negating bubbles
		IRSIM does not write parasitics
	Automatic icon generation (for Tom):
		Thick black box instead of thin red box
		Have nice little black tabs extending from box for each export
		Tabs and exports move appropriately when black box resized (alternatively, could allow user to specify size of box upon generation)
		Place exports same relative location as in schematic
	Multi-line text that is Boxed is not drawn right
	Pasting without the "move after paste" doesn't do intelligent remembering of offset
	How to show results of good NCC?
		(how about ^K)
		How about boolean of whether it's passed NCC (for CellLists)

Yea, yea:
	Change the term "Node" to "Shape" for outline primitives:
		Types of nodes: pins, contacts, specials (transistors, etc.), and "shapes"
	On Windows, maximize an edit window then click on component menu title bar...big mess
	Way to find all resources that start with a string (for LibFile.getSpicePartsLibraries())
	Have DRC do CIF-style grid checking
	Have "Layer Visibility" offer range by height, so for example you can make M1-M4 invisible (for Tom)

JOptionPane:
	ERROR MESSAGE:
		JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(TopLevel.getCurrentJFrame(), "You did something wrong", "Error Has Happened", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);
	CONFIRMATION:
		int response = JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(TopLevel.getCurrentJFrame(), "OK?");
		if (response == JOptionPane.YES_OPTION) return "Want Yes";
	PROMPT FOR TYPED VALUE:
		String editedValue = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("The Value:", "initial");
		if (editedValue == null) return;
	CHOOSE AMONG SMALL NUMBER OF CHOICES:
		String [] options = {"Yes", "No", "Cancel"};
		int ret = JOptionPane.showOptionDialog(TopLevel.getCurrentJFrame(),
			"What do you want?", "Dialog to Make a Decision",
			JOptionPane.DEFAULT_OPTION, JOptionPane.WARNING_MESSAGE, null, options, "No");
		if (ret == 0) return "Want Yes";
		if (ret == 1) return "Want No";
		if (ret == 2) return "Want Cancel";
	CHOOSE AMONG LARGE NUMBER OF CHOICES:
		String [] manyOptions = {"a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"};
        String chosen = (String)JOptionPane.showInputDialog(TopLevel.getCurrentJFrame(), "Choose one",
            "Make a Choice", JOptionPane.QUESTION_MESSAGE, null, manyOptions, "c");
        if (chosen == null) return;

============================ UNCONVERTED FROM C ELECTRIC ============================

High priority:
	Schematic technology: Complex bus-pin visibility when viewed from up the hierarchy
	"Window / Saved Views"
	"Window / Highlight Layer"
	"Window / Component Menu..."
	Input: LEF
	Input: DEF
	Input: DXF
	IRSIM simulator
	ALS simulator
	Special get-info dialogs for transistor size, resistance, etc.
	Compaction
	Technology editing
	PSpice (aka spice3) output cannot be read

Low priority:
	Project management
	Edge alignment
	Technologies: fpga
	"Technology / Document Technology"
	Output: HPGL
	Dracula interface
	CMOS PLA generation
	Convert to VHDL ("View / Make VHDL View")
	VHDL compiler
	Silicon compiler

Will never happen:
	Network: "Analyze Cell Network"
	nMOS PLA generation
	"Window / Window Partitions"
	MOCMOS stick figures
   	Ability to disable differential ports on AND, OR, and XOR
	Multithreaded DRC
	Technologies: cmosdodn, epic7s, ziptronics

============================ THE C STACK ============================

Steps to do conversion:
	Convert:
		NODEPROTO: "FACET_message", "FACET_original_facet", "FACET_characteristic_spacing",
			"FACET_essentialbounds", "FACET_schematic_page_size"
		TOOL: "USER_facet_explorer_textsize", "USER_default_facet_text_size"

Simulation:
	Frequency plots
	Set any signal onto the X axis, not just time
	Ability to display amperes
	Logarithmic axes
	Measurement files (et1.mt0), how do I plot them?
	If the resistance of a net between two exports exceeds the min resistance, the two exports should be netlisted
		separately with a resistor between.  Otherwise, they can be merged into a single net.
	SPICE netlisting of AS, AD, PS, and PD fields should work like irsim
	Verilog needs way to set gate delays and gate signal strengths on per-instance basis
	IRSIM:
		Making a bus in IRSIM with "b" should create a "vector" command
		Inserting stimulus inside of "c" must break it into individual "s" commands
		Handle "@" command for commandfiles
		by default, put clocks first, then inputs, then bidir, then outputs, then internal nets
		by default, display the exported signals and explicitly named internal nets
		support the analyzer (ana for short) IRSIM command to add signals to the list being viewed
		provide hierarchy browser to add signals.  Three panes: hierarchy level, exports, internal signals
		use hierarchy browser to go up and down levels.  In it, provide an option to view the sch/layout during sim.
		accept IRSIM stimulus at the command line as well as in a command file (essentially replace
			command language accepted by the simulator window, at least for IRSIM)
		Remove "0b", "0x" and "0" prefixes from busses, say what base in upper-left
		"clear all vectors" doesn't work if there is a command-file after base is changed
		round cursor location to either .5 or .1 multiples of scale that fits in window
		autoscroll when dragging signals in simulation window
		ability to drag multiple selected signals
		add signal by typing "a" when signal is selected in layout or sch window
DRC:
	Graphical DRC specification
	Option to correct errors
	Save the DRC errors somewhere so that when electric crashes you don't have to re-run DRC
		for 8 hrs to get back to where you were before the crash.
	If you place a pure layer node of active, it must be surrounded by 2 lambda of 
		select on all sides
	DRC doesn't flag MOSIS rule 8.5
ERC:
	Tying ERC results to NCC to validate 4th (bias) port
	ERC to find shortest (geometrically) path between two points on a network
	Check that all power connected together, all ground connected together
	Find short circuits (from power to ground)
	Count transistors wired in parallel
	Way to display "loops" in a circuit
	Way to find the closest nontouching point on a network
	Find components with floating nodes
Routing:
	Channel router
	River routing:
		Should be able to route to the top or right (does bottom/left)
		Way to get "unrouted" wires to mimic sensibly
		Way to place unrouted wires intelligently
		Handle mixed-arc river routing (route only selected?)

Miscellaneous:
	Node extractor
	Tapered arcs
	Multifinger transistors in schematics (more than 1 base/emitter)
	Way to un-skeletonize ("library merge" command to copy more recent/real cells)
	Propagate cell date/version hierarchically
	Overview window
	Prevent negative wires during moves
	Under the "Windows" menu if would be nice to include a list of all the open windows
	Butting substrate contacts
	Transistor primitives should have bus ports instead of wire ports
	Scheme for describing facet dependencies (i.e. "netlist generated from VHDL") and give warnings on edit
	Prevent Compactor from moving "facet center".  Option to move toward it
	"cleanup" should handle:
		Unattached/unexported wire obscured by other wire
		Wire that doubles back on itself
	Technology editor:
		Cannot reconstruct the Multiplier primitive from the Efido technology
		Should allow serpentine transistors that don't have crossing active
		Can there be two contact cuts in a primitive? what about multi-cut situations?
	EPS bounding box not right when image is rotated
	Generalized listing of exports:
		How do I search for all power type exports that DON'T have a certain name?
		How do I search for all exports that are on the Vdd or ground nets?
	Never create non 45-degree polygons for closed geometries, such as the letter `a' in layout text
	Constraints:
		An "anchor" constraint
		Add simpler constraints to replace rigidity and orthogonality
			wire length/angle flexibility, wire-to-node angle flexibility
		Add more constraints for more powerful work
			wire length/angle range, wire-to-node angle range

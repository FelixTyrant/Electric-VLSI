<!-- HEADER 1-4-1: Introduction to Source Code -->

It is not necessary to rebuild Electric from the source code because the downloads are ready to run.
For people who wish to explore the source code, this section describes how you can do it.
<P>
Source code is available in two forms:
<UL>
<li><b>Packaged in the JAR file</b><br>
The Electric download from GNU has source code in it.
You can extract this code and build Electric.
See <A HREF="chap01-04-02.html#chap01-04-02">Section 1-4-2</A> for more.<br><br>
</li>

<li><b>At java.net</b><br>

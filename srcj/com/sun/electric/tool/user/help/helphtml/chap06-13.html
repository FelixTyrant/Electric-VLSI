Electric implements an interface to the Concurrent Versioning System (CVS) program,
a popular version control system.
<P>
To enable Electric to use CVS,
you must first configure the CVS preferences under
<B>File / Preferences...</B>, "General" section, "CVS" tab.  CVS must be enabled,
and the repository location must be specified.  Electric does not implement
the CVS protocol, it merely provides an interface to interact with an external
CVS program, so that program must be specified in the preferences.
<P>
The Electric GUI allows the user to perform the common CVS commands via
the menu <B>File / CVS</B>, or via the popup-context menu on the libraries
and cells listed in the explorer tree.
<P>
This help section assumes the user is familiar with how CVS works, and the
various CVS commands.  Such information is readily available on the web.
<P>
With CVS enabled in Electric, the explorer tree uses colors to show the
state of libraries or cells in CVS.  When using a JELIB or ELIB library
format, the library name and all cells are the same color, because
the entire library is a single file.  When using
a DELIB format, the cells are different color, because each cell
is its own file.  The colors and their associated state
are shown below.  Colors at the top of the table will be displayed before colors
at the bottom of the table, if two states are simultaneously valid.

<CENTER><TABLE border="1">
<TR><TD><B>State</B></TD><TD><B>Color</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Conflicts with CVS version</TD><TD><font color="#ff0000">Red</font></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Up-to-date</TD><TD>Black</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
To manipulate all libraries, use commands under <B>File / CVS</B>.
<P>
To manipulate single libraries or single cells, right-click (context-menu click)
on libraries or cells in the explorer tree, and look in the CVS sub-menu.
<P>
The common commands implemented by Electric are:

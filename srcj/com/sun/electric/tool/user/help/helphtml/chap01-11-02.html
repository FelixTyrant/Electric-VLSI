<!-- HEADER 1-11-2: Schematics Example: Make a Node -->

<TABLE><TR><TD>
Logic elements are placed by selecting nodes from the components menu,
and then wiring them together.
This example shows two nodes that have been created.
This was done by clicking on the appropriate component menu entry,
and then clicking again in the editing window to place that node.
After clicking on the component menu entry,
the cursor changes to a pointing hand to indicate that you must select a location for the node.
When placing the node, if you press the button and do not release it,
you will see an outline of the new node,
which you can drag to its proper location before releasing the button.

<P>
In this example,
the top node is called a Buffer (found in the seventh entry from the bottom of the component menu).
The node on the bottom is called an And (eighth entry from the bottom of the component menu).
Both of these nodes are from the Schematic technology
(which is listed as "schematics" in the status area).

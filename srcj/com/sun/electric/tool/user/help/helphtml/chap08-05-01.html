The routing tool contains a number of different subsystems for creating wires.
Two <I>stitching</I> routers can be used in array-based design to connect adjoining cells.
A maze-router runs individual wires.
A river-router is also available for running multiple parallel wires.
<P>
Some of these routers make use of the "Unrouted Arc",
a thin-line arc that can connect any two components.
Creating "rats nests" of these arcs forms a graphical specification that the router can use.
The unrouted arc is from the Generic Technology
(see <A HREF="chap07-06-02.html#chap07-06-02">Section 7-6-2</A>).
To create one, use the <B>Get Unrouted Wire</B> command (in menu <B>Tool / Routing</B>).
Then use standard wiring commands to run the unrouted arc.
Another way to get unrouted wires is to select all or part of an existing route
(made with any arc) and use the <B>Unroute</B> command.
<P>
Finally, the <B>Copy Routing Topology</B> and <B>Paste Routing Topology</B>
commands can be used to create unrouted arcs in one cell (the "pasted" cell)
where there are connections of any kind on another cell (the "copied" cell).
The <B>Paste Routing Topology</B> command uses node and arc names to associate the two cells.

The rest of this section describes the use of this dialog.

<H3>Lambda</H3>
<P>
The right side of the <B>Change Units...</B> is used to manipulate the value of Lambda.
Lambda is the basic unit of design, expressed in internal units.
For example, the MOSIS CMOS technology has transistors that are 2x3 lambda units in size,
and a value of lambda that is 400.
Because the internal unit is the half-nanometer (the half millimicron),
400 internal units is 0.2 microns,
and the transistor is 0.4 by 0.6 microns in size.
Note that the value of lambda is shown in the status area.
<P>
Each library has a list of lambda values for each technology.
This means that two libraries can have different lambda values for the same technology,
and this can cause trouble if the libraries reference each other.
Because of this, when a library is read in with lambda values that are different from existing libraries,
you are presented with a dialog to help resolve these differences.

<P>
You can choose to scale the new library or the existing libraries so that they match.
You can also choose to ignore the problem if you know that the inconsistent lambda values will not cause trouble.
<P>
If you use the <B>Change Units...</B> command and change the value of lambda,
you have three choices for how to adjust the existing circuitry:
<UL>
<LI>"Change no libraries" causes the technology to scale, but existing objects are left alone.
This may cause existing objects to change their aspect ratio, even if they don't change their physical size.
<LI>"Change current library" causes the technology and all objects in the current library to scale.
The objects and their cells will now be at a different size, but will appear the same as before.
<LI>"Change all libraries" causes the technology and all objects in all libraries to scale.
The objects and their cells will now be at a different size, but will appear the same as before.
</UL>
For example, if you change lambda for the "mocmossub" technology from 400 to 800,
and you scale the libraries, then the existing 2x3 lambda transistor will be affected.
Its area area will now be 0.8 by 1.2 microns in size.
Thus, lambda-based designs are scalable to the desired process.

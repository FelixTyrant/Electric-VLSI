<!-- HEADER 1-2: Setup and Requirements -->

Electric is written in the Java programming language and is distributed as a single ".jar" file,
typically called "electric.jar".
There are two variations on the ".jar" file: with or without source code.
Either form can run Electric, but the source-code form is larger because it also has
all of the Java code.
<P>
Electric requires Java version 1.3 or later.

Running Electric varies with the different platforms:

<!-- HEADER 8-4-4: Spice and Verilog Primitives -->

Electric has a set of SPICE elements (DC Voltage Source, CCCS, Pulse, etc.)
that create appropriate SPICE deck cards.
These elements are found in the readable dump file "spiceparts.txt" in the "lib" directory.
This library consists of a set of icon cells that describe the various SPICE primitives,
and each icon has a special <I>Spice Template</I> that describes the SPICE card to generate.
<P>
Users can define their own SPICE elements by creating new icons in this or a new library.
The icon must have graphics, exports, parameters, and a template.
Parameters are created with the <B>Cell Parameters...</B> subcommand of the <B>Attributes</B>
command of the <B>Info</B> menu (see <A HREF="chap06-08.html#chap06-08">Section 6-8</A> for more on parameters).
The SPICE template is created with the <B>Set Generic SPICE Template</B> subcommand of the <B>Simulation (SPICE)</B>
command of the <B>Tools</B> menu.
If the template is specific to a particular version of SPICE, use the appropriate template subcommand
(<B>Set SPICE 2 Template</B>, <B>Set SPICE 3 Template</B>, <B>Set HSPICE Template</B>, <B>Set PSPICE Template</B>,
<B>Set GnuCAP Template</B>, or <B>Set SmartSPICE Template</B>).
<P>
You can also create Verilog elements by using the <B>Set Verilog Template</B> subcommand of the <B>Simulation (Verilog)</B>
command of the <B>Tools</B> menu.
This template has the format as illustrated below.
Note that a single cell can contain both Verilog and multiple SPICE templates.

<TABLE><TR><TD>
The DC Voltage Source primitive is illustrated here.
Graphics is placed to describe the look of the symbol (a "battery" look).
Exports are created at the top and bottom of the battery with the names "plus" and "minus".
A single parameter is defined called "Voltage" with a default value of "0V".
Finally, a SPICE template is created that has the string
<BR><CENTER><CODE>V$(node_name) $(plus) $(minus) DC $(Voltage)</CODE></CENTER><BR>
</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-23.png" ALT="Figure 9.23"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
This string contains substitution expressions of the form <CODE>$(SOMETHING)</CODE>
where <CODE>SOMETHING</CODE> can be an export name, a variable, or "node_name".
So, in this example, <CODE>$(node_name)</CODE> will be replaced with the name of the voltage node;
<CODE>$(plus)</CODE> will be replaced with the net name attached to the positive terminal;
and <CODE>$(Voltage)</CODE> will be replaced with the voltage value specified by the user.
<P>
The set of SPICE primitives in Electric is useful, but far from complete.
A second set, called "SpicePartsS3", is tailored towards special SPICE3 primitives.
There are no Verilog primitives in the current release of Electric.
Users who define new primitives are encouraged to share these with the entire community by contacting

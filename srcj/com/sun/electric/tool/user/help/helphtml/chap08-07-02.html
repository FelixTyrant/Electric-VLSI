<!-- COMMAND Tool/Generation/Coverage Implants Generator -->

There are other generators built into Electric.
These commands (in menu <B>Tool / Generation</B>) may be used:

    <B>Coverage Implants Generator</B>
    Although individual MOS nodes and arcs have the proper amount of implant around them,
    a collection of such objects may result in an irregular implant boundary.
    To clean this up, you can place pure-layer nodes of implant that neatly cover the implant area.
    This command does it automatically.
    It removes previous pieces of coverage implant before running, so that the result is a clean cover.

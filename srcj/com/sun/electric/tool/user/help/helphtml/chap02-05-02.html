<!-- HEADER 2-5-2: Arc Sizing -->

To change the size of an arc, follow similar procedures.
Select the arc and issue the <B>Interactively</B> subcommand.
Note that the arc stretches about its center so that an edge is at the cursor location.
Click a button to make the change.
To change the size of more than one arc at a time, select the arcs and use the <B>All Selected Arcs</B> subcommand.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Another way to change size is to select the node or arc and use the <B>Get Info</B> command of the <B>Info</B> menu.
Type new X and Y sizes into the dialog for nodes; type a new Width into the dialog for arcs.
<P>
The arc <B>Get Info</B> dialog also has an "Easy to Select" checkbox,
and if you uncheck it,
you will have to use the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:meta-left  Windows:alt-left  Mac:opt-click">special select</A></I>
button to select the arc in the future.

<P>
Note that when typing size amounts into a dialog, specify the size of the highlighted area.
In a typical MOS transistor, the highlighted area
(where active and polysilicon cross) is 2x3,
even though the component is much larger if you include the four overlap regions sticking out.
A CMOS active arc shows highlighting only on its active area,
even though the complete arc has implant regions that are much larger.
Also note that the X and Y sizes of a node will be swapped if the node is rotated onto its side.
Finally, note that the default unit for typed values is <I>lambda</I>,
unless another unit is explicitly mentioned (for more information on lambda,
<A HREF="chap07-02.html#chap07-02">Section 7-2</A>).

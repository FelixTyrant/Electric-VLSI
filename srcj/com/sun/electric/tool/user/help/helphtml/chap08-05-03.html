One problem with the auto-stitcher is that it may take a different view of the circuit than originally intended.
In an area where more than two cells meet,
the auto-stitcher may place many wires in an attempt to connect all touching ports.
Another problem with the auto-stitcher is that it makes explicit only what is already implicit,
and so cannot add all necessary wires.
<P>
To control the wiring of arrays of cells more directly,
there is the mimic-stitcher.
This tool lets the designer place a wire between two cells,
and then it adds other wires between all other similarly configured cells in the circuit.
Thus, it mimics your actions.
<P>
Specifically, all situations where the same ports on the same type of nodes exist,
separated by the same distance.
<P>
The "Routing" preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Routing" tab)
has many useful controls for mimic stitching.

First, you can request that the mimic stitcher also mimic wire deletions.
Second, you can request that the mimic stitcher relax its restriction about mimicing arcs
(by allowing the ports to be different, the nodes to be different, or the node sizes to be different).
You can also ask the mimic stitcher to work interactively,
which causes it to examine all possible restriction sets,
offering to route wires with increasingly relaxed acceptance criteria.

To turn on the mimic-stitcher, use the <B>Enable Mimic-Stitching</B> command
(in menu <B>Tool / Routing</B>).
To disable the stitcher, use the command to uncheck it.
You can also request that the mimic-stitcher run just once
(mimicing the very last wire that was created or deleted) by using the <B>Mimic-Stitch Now</B> command.
Finally, you can request that the mimic-stitcher run just once, mimicing the currently selected arc,
by using the <B>Mimic Selected</B> command.

<!-- COMMAND Help/Load Samples Library -->

A <I>technology</I> is an environment in which design is done.
Technologies can be layout specific, for example MOSIS CMOS,
or they can be abstract, for example Schematics and Artwork.
There are multiple CMOS variations to handle popular design rules such as MOSIS, submicron,
etc.
<P>
Each technology consists of a set of <I>primitive nodes</I> and <I>arcs</I>.
These, in turn, are constructed from one or more <I>layers</I>.
Each technology also includes information necessary to do design,
such as design rules, connectivity rules, simulation information, etc.
<P>
The primitive nodes in a technology come in three styles:
<I>pins</I>, <I>components</I>, and <I>pure-layer nodes</I>.
The pins are used to join arcs, so there is one pin for every arc in the technology.
The components are the basic nodes used in design: contacts, transistors, etc.
Finally, the pure-layer nodes are used for geometric manipulation
(see <A HREF="chap06-10-01.html#chap06-10-01">Section 6-10-1</A>).
There is one pure-layer node for every layer in the technology.
<P>
The component menu on the left side of the editing window shows arcs at the bottom
(the menu entries with red border), pin nodes above that
(these appear as boxes with a cross inside),
and components after that
(the more complex layer combinations).
The pure-layer nodes are available under the entry labeled "Pure".
<P>
Electric has a "sample" library built into it that illustrates many features.
To access it, use the <B>Load Samples Library</B> command (in menu <B>Help</B>).
The table below lists the cells in that library which illustrate different technologies:

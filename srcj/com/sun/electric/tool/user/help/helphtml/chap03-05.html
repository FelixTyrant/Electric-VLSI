<!-- HEADER 3-5: Moving Up and Down the Hierarchy -->

<!-- COMMAND Cell/Down Hierarchy -->
<!-- COMMAND Cell/Down Hierarchy In Place -->
<!-- COMMAND Cell/Up Hierarchy -->

Each editing window in Electric displays a single cell.
Editing changes can be made only to that cell, and not to any subcells that appear as instances.
Thus, you may be able to see the contents of a cell instance,
but you cannot edit it.
<P>
To edit a cell instance, use the <B>Down Hierarchy</B> command (in menu <B>Cell</B>).
This command will descend into the definition of the currently selected cell instance.
The contents will appear at the same size and location as the instance,
and you will now be able to edit the contents.
<P>
If an icon is selected, the <B>Down Hierarchy</B> command will take you to the associated schematic.
If the icon that is selected is already in its own schematic
(you can place an icon inside its own schematic for documentation purposes),
then the <B>Down Hierarchy</B> command takes you to the actual icon so that you can edit it.
<P>
If a layout cell is selected, you can use the <B>Down Hierarchy In Place</B> command to
edit the cell while showing the upper level of the hierarchy.
The surrounding geometry at the upper level is not editable, and is grayed-out.
<P>
Schematic nodes can be arrayed by giving them array names
(see <A HREF="chap06-09-03.html#chap06-09-03">Section 6-9-3</A>).
When you descend into an arrayed node, the system does not know which element of the array
you are entering.
Most of the time, the specific element is irrelevant, but if the circuit is being simulated,
the specific instance may be necessary for cross-probing.
Therefore, if the cell is being simulated and you descend into an arrayed node, you will be
prompted for the specific element that you wish to visit.
There are other situations that cannot be detected, where the specific element needs to be known.
To solve this problem, you can request that Electric prompt for the specific element
in all situations where an arrayed node is visited.
To do this, check "Always prompt for index when descending into array nodes"
in the "General" preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "General" section, "General" tab)
<P>
The <B>Up Hierarchy</B> command pops you to the next higher cell in the hierarchy.
If there was an associated <B>Down Hierarchy</B> command,
then this returns you to the place where you started, up the hierarchy.
If the <B>Down Hierarchy</B> commands were not used,
Electric attempts to figure out the next higher cell in the hierarchy,
switching icons for schematics where appropriate.
If there are multiple possibilities
(because the current cell is used in many locations) then you will be prompted for a specific location.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Besides using the <B>Up Hierarchy</B> and <B>Down Hierarchy</B> commands, you can also use
the tool bar "back" and "forward" buttons to move through the hierarchy.

<P>
When going down or up the hierarchy, if an export or port is selected,
then the equivalent port or export is shown after the level of hierarchy has changed.

<!-- HEADER 4-6-3: Editing Patterns -->

<TABLE><TR><TD>
Besides editing colors, it is also possible to assign them to layers and to edit each layer's stipple patterns.
The <B>Layer Display Options...</B> command of the <B>Windows</B> menu gives you this facility.
Although many layers are drawn with solid colors on a color display, they all have
patterns that are used for hardcopy output.
The dialog that appears with this command allows the patterns to be edited,
provides a set of predefined patterns, and allows you to determine whether or not the pattern is used on the display.
You also have the option of outlining stippled polygons with a solid line.
Finally, you can assign any transparent or opaque color to a layer.

<!-- HEADER 4-3: Creating and Deleting Editing Windows -->

<!-- COMMAND Window/Close Window -->
<!-- COMMAND Window/Adjust Position/Tile Horizontally -->
<!-- COMMAND Window/Adjust Position/Tile Vertically -->
<!-- COMMAND Window/Adjust Position/Cascade -->

Initially, there is only one editing window on the screen.
Electric allows you to create multiple editing windows,
each of which can show a different cell.
You can also have the same cell in more than one window to see it at different scales and locations.
<P>
New windows are created by checking the appropriate checkbox in the <B>New Cell...</B> or <B>Edit Cell...</B>
commands (in menu <B>Cell</B>).
New windows can also be created from the cell explorer by using the context button on a cell name.
<P>
To delete a window, click its close box, or use the <B>Close Window</B> command (in menu <B>Window</B>).
Note that you cannot delete the last window on UNIX systems,
because the UNIX pulldown menus are part of the edit windows.
<P>
When there are many editing windows on the display,
you can arrange them neatly with the <B>Window / Adjust Position</B> commands.
The <B>Tile Horizontally</B> command adjusts the windows so that they are full-width,
but just tall enough to fill the screen, one above the other.
The <B>Tile Vertically</B> command adjusts the windows so that they are full-height,
but just wide enough to fill the screen, one next to the other.
The <B>Cascade</B> command adjusts the windows so that they are all the same size and overlap each other uniformly from the upper-left to the lower-right.

Components can be moved by clicking on them with the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">left</A></I> button and then dragging them around while keeping the button pressed.
During the drag, the new location of the components will be shown (as well as the amount of motion),
and once the button is released the circuitry will be moved.
<P>
Another way to move objects is to use the arrow keys.
When a node or arc is selected, each press of an arrow key moves that object by one grid unit.
If the shift key or the control key is held, then the arrow keys move the object by a block of grid units.
A block of grid units is defined in the <B>Preferences...</B> dialog ("Grid" tab of the "Display" section)
to be the frequency of bold dots in the grid,
 initially 10.
If you hold both the shift key and the control key,
then the distance moved will be a block squared (i.e. initially 100).
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
The distance that the arrow keys move is also affected by the <B>Movement</B> commands (in menu <B>Edit / Modes</B>).
These commands are also available in the tool bar.

<P>
The <B>Quarter</B> command causes the amount to be quartered (so unshifted arrow keys will move by a quarter lambda).
The <B>Half</B> command causes the amount to be halved (so unshifted arrow keys will move by a half lambda).
The <B>Full</B> command causes the amount to be full (so unshifted arrow keys will move by lambda).
Note that these menu items are attached to the "q", "h", and "f" keys and are also in the tool bar.
<P>
To move objects along only one line (just horizontally or vertically but not both),
hold the Control key down during motion.
Note that holding the Control key down before clicking will change the nature of the mouse action,
so you must click first, and then press Control.
When editing schematics, this will constrain objects to movement along 45 degree angles.
<P>
When arcs are moved by a large amount, they cause the connecting nodes to move with them.
However, for small arc motion, the arc may shift within its ports.
This can only happen if the port has nonzero area and if the arc has the <I>slidable</I> constraint
(shown with the letter "S" when highlighted).
These constraints are discussed in greater detail in <A HREF="chap05-02-02.html#chap05-02-02">Section 5-2-2</A>.

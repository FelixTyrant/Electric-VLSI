Electric is able to compare two different cells and determine whether their networks have the same topology.
This operation is sometimes called Layout vs. Schematic (LVS),
but because Electric can compare any two circuits (including two layouts or two schematics)
the term Network Consistency Checking (NCC) is used.
Electric's NCC system is based on the
<A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/lis/www/gemini/gemini.html">Gemini</A> work of Carl Ebeling
(see Ebeling, Carl, "GeminiII: A Second Generation Layout Validation Program",
<I>Proceedings of ICCAD</I> 1988, p322-325.)
<P>
To compare two cells, use these commands (in menu <B>Tool / NCC</B>):
<UL>
<LI>
   <B>Flat NCC schematic and layout of current cell</B>
   compares the current cell and its equivalent schematic or layout.
</LI>
<LI>
   <B>Flat NCC two cells from open windows</B>
   compares two cells that are the two opened windows (there must be exactly two windows).
</LI>
<LI>
   <B>Flat NCC each cell in the design, current cell is root</B>
   compares the current cell and its equivalent schematic or layout, and then recurses down the hierarchy.
</LI>
<LI>
   <B>Hierarchical NCC each cell in the design, current cell is root</B>
   compares the current cell and its equivalent schematic or layout, and then recurses down the hierarchy.
</LI>
</UL>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
There is only one NCC setting, available in the "NCC" preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "NCC" tab).
Component sizes can be allowed up to a specified amount or percentage.

<P>
For an example of network consistency checking,
open the Samples library (in menu <B>Help / Load Samples Library</B>) and compare the cells "tool-NCC{lay}" and "tool-NCC{sch}"
.
These two cells are equivalent and the checker will find them to be so.

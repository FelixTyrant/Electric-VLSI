<!-- HEADER 8-4-5: Spice Plotting -->

Once SPICE has been run,
you can see a plot of the simulation by reading the SPICE output file back into Electric.
Since there are may formats of SPICE output, you must first set the "SPICE Engine" and the "Output format" fields of the
<B>SPICE Options...</B> dialog.
The "Output format" field can be "Standard" for the default output of the SPICE engine; "Raw" for rawfile dumps;
and "Raw/Smart" for the rawfile dumps from SmartSPICE.
<P>
<!-- NEED 4in -->
When Electric knows what type of SPICE output file to expect, use the <B>Plot SPICE Listing...</B> command to read the file
(or just <B>Plot Spice for This Cell</B> if the cell name and file name are the same).
The waveforms will appear in a window:
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-04.png" ALT="Figure 9.4"></CENTER>
<P>
The waveform window is tied to an associated schematics or layout window.
Clicking on a signal in the waveform windows highlights the equivalent circuitry in the other window,
and clicking on an arc in the schematics or layout window causes the waveform signal to be selected.
Both the waveform window and the associated schematics/layout window are highlighted with a red border to indicate that they are part of the simulation activity.
<P>
The horizontal axis of the simulation window shows time.
Two vertical lines are drawn, called the "main" and the "extension" cursors
(the extension cursor has an "X" drawn at its top).
You can click over these cursors and drag them to different time locations.
The location of the cursors, and the value of the selected signal at those times, is shown at the top.
The time axis can also be controlled with the appropriate <B>Windows</B> menu commands.
Use <B>Zoom Out</B> and <B>Zoom In</B> to scale the time axis by a factor of two.
Use <B>Fill Window</B> to display the entire range of data, fit to the screen.
Use <B>Focus on Highlighted</B> to display the range between the main and extension cursors.
<P>
You can control which signals are displayed in the waveform window.
To remove a signal, select its name and type "r" or the DELETE key.
When adding a signal, you have a choice of showing it overlaid with an existing signal, or in its own graph.
Typing "o" causes the signal to be overlaid onto the currently selected signal,
and typing "a" causes the signal to be added in its own "frame".
If you type "o" or "a" into the waveform window, you will be prompted for a list of signal names to display.
If you type "o" or "a" in the assiciated schematics/layout window,
then the selected signal from that window will be added to the waveform display.
<P>
Besides the time axis, it is possible to zoom and pan the vertical axis of a frame of the waveform window.
Typing '7' doubles the scale (zooms-in) and typing '0' halves the scale (zooms-out).
Type '9' to restore the scale so that the data fills the screen.
Use '8' and '2' to shift the data values up and down.
<P>
One final feature is the ability to take a snapshot of the waveform window.
Typing "p" preserves the waveform in the database
(a cell with the "simulation-snapshot" view is created with artwork components).
<P>

<!-- HEADER 9-6-6: Sea-of-Gates Routing -->

<!-- COMMAND Tool/Routing/Sea-Of-Gates Route -->

The sea-of-gates router is able to take an arbitrary set of unrouted arcs and convert them to layout.
<P>
To do this, use the <B>Sea-Of-Gates Route</B> command (in menu <B>Tool / Routing</B>).
If there are unrouted arcs selected, these will be the only ones converted.
Otherwise, all unrouted arcs in the cell will be converted.

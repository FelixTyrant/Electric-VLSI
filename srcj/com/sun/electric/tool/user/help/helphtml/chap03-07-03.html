<!-- HEADER 3-7-3: Cell Preferences -->

To examine and set more information about existing cells,
use the <B>Cell Options...</B> command of the <B>Cells</B> menu:

<P>
The upper part of the dialog provides options on a per-cell basis
(choose the library and the cell and then set its options).
The checkbox "Disallow modification of anything in this cell",
allows you to control whether the contents of a cell is editable or not.
When modification is disallowed, no changes may be made.
This is useful when you want to allow examination without accidental modification.
The checkbox "Disallow modification of instances in this cell",
also prevents changes to the selected cell, but in this case, only sub-instances are locked.
This is useful when you have a correct instance placement and are doing wiring.
Buttons on the right allow you to set or clear these flags for all cells.
<TABLE><TR><TD>
If you make a change that has been disallowed,
a dialog appears that asks if you want to override the lock.
You may make the change, disallow the change, or remove the lock
(which effectively unchecks the locks in the <B>Cell Options...</B> dialog).

<P>
The check box "Part of a cell-library"
indicates that this cell is from a library of standard cells and should be treated accordingly.
Buttons on the right allow you to set or clear this flag for all cells.
Most dialogs that list cells can remove those from cell-libraries to keep the list simpler.
<P>
The check box "Use technology editor on this cell"
indicates that this cell part of a technology editor library.
Editing of cells in a technology editor library is done in a special mode (indicated with a yellow border in the window).
See <A HREF="chap08-02.html#chap08-02">Section 8-2</A> for more information about technology editing.
<P>
The "Expand new instances" and "Unexpand new instances"
buttons choose whether newly created instances of this cell are expanded
(contents visible) or unexpanded (drawn with a black outline)
See <A HREF="chap03-04.html#chap03-04">Section 3-4</A> for more on expansion.
<P>
The "Characteristic Spacing" is the spacing of this cell when arrayed
(see <A HREF="chap06-04.html#chap06-04">Section 6-4</A>).
<P>
The lower part of the dialog contains options that will apply to all cells.
The check box "Check Cell dates during creation"
requests that date information be used to ensure a proper circuit building sequence.
When this box is checked,
warning messages will be issued when editing a cell that has more recent subcell instances.
Electric tracks cell creation and revision dates,
and this information can be displayed with the <B>Describe this Cell</B>
command and others in the <B>Cells</B> menu.
<P>
The check box "Switch technology to match current cell"
requests that the current technology automatically change whenever the current cell changes so that the two match.
<P>
The check box "Place Cell-Center in new cells"
requests that all newly created cells have a Cell-Center node (named "Facet-Center" for historical reasons) placed at the origin
(see <A HREF="chap03-03.html#chap03-03">Section 3-3</A> for more on Cell centers).
<P>
The check box "Tiny cells hashed out"
requests that cells be displayed with a gray hash pattern when they are too tiny for their contents to be distinguished.
Without this option, all geometry is drawn, which can take a long time.
You can control the threshold of "tinyness" by setting the number of lambda units per pixel.
Any view in which this many lambda units are shown in pixel will be too small to display fully.

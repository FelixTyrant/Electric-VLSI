<!-- HEADER 2-2-2: Arc Creation -->

As the introductory example showed, arcs are created by clicking the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">right</A></I> button.
This can actually function in two different ways, depending on what is highlighted.
<P>
If one node is highlighted, <I>segment wiring</I> is done,
in which an arc is drawn from the highlighted node to the location of the cursor.
If there is nothing at that location, a pin is created, and it is left highlighted.
Using the <I>right</I> button again runs an arc from the pin to another location.
By clicking and holding the <I>right</I> button,
you can see the path that the new arc will follow.
<P>
If the cursor is over another object when this command is issued,
the new wire attaches to that object.
<P>
In general, all wiring operations should be done by clicking and <U>holding</U> the <I>right</I> button,
then moving the cursor until the intended wiring is shown,
and finally releasing.
This is recommended because wiring is quite complex and can follow many different paths.
<P>
The other way that the creation button can operate is <I>two-point wiring</I>,
in which two nodes are highlighted and one or more arcs are created to connect them.
Highlighting of these two nodes is done by clicking the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">left</A></I> button over the first one,
and then using the <I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">shift-left</A></I> button on the second.
Note that if the second node is obscured by other objects, you can cycle through the objects under the cursor with the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">control-shift-left</A></I> button.
Once the two nodes are highlighted,
use the <I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">right</A></I> button to wire them together.
Note that the highlighted ports on the selected nodes are important:
arcs will run between them, so they must be compatible in their wiring capabilities.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Two-point wire creation first attempts to run a single arc.
Generally, this can happen only if the ports are lined up accurately.
Failing single arc placement,
an attempt is made to connect with two or three arcs and intermediate nodes.
The determination of arc location depends upon the position of the cursor when the right button is clicked.
If the cursor is inside of the area defined by the two components,
the connection will make a "Z" bend through the cursor.
If the cursor is to one side of the components,
the connection will make a "U" bend through the cursor location.
Finally, if the cursor is in a corner outside of the components,
the connection will make an "L" bend towards the cursor.
<p>Please Note: Only "L" shaped connections are implemented at this time.
</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig02-04.png" ALT="Figure 2.4"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
The nature of the connection can also be affected by the directionality of the ports,
which, if it exists, will override cursor location to obtain a sensible connection.
Note that for "Z" bends, there are two arcs in one direction, and a third that is perpendicular to them.
If there are no other factors (such as directionality),
the orientation of the "Z" is made so that the perpendicular arc is shortest.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig02-05.png" ALT="Figure 2.5"></CENTER></TD><TD>
In addition to running an arc between two nodes,
you can also use arcs as the starting or ending point of arc creation.
If it is sensible,
the creation command actually uses one of the nodes on an end of the selected arc.
However, if the connection falls inside the arc,
it is split and a new node is created to make a "T" connection.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Electric will allow you to connect two nodes or arcs as long as there is some way in the current
technology for those objects to be connected.  For example, if connecting between metal-1-pin and
a metal-3-pin in the MOSIS CMOS technology, Electric will place metal-1-metal-2 and metal-2-metal-3
contact cuts down, and wire between all four nodes.
<P>
As mentioned in the <I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">Mouse Interface</A></I> page, pressing
the number keys for a valid layer switches to that layer.  If a node is highlighted, it will
route to that layer from the node, creating contacts as necessary.
<P>
Whenever an arc is created, the system makes a clicking sound.
The sound is a single click for one arc, a double-click for two arcs, and a triple-click for three or more arcs.
To disable this sound, use the <B>Preferences...</B> command of the <B>File</B> menu,
select the "New Arcs" tab in the "General" section, and uncheck "Play click sounds when arcs are created".

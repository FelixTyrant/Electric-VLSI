<!-- HEADER 4-5: Layer Visibility -->

<TABLE><TR><TD>
The nodes and arcs on the display are composed of more basic <I>layers</I>.
By using the "Layers" tab of the Side Bar,
you can control which layers are actually drawn.
<P>
A dialog is presented showing the layers in the current technology.
When a layer is checked, it is visible.
You can turn the check on and off by double-clicking on a line.
You can also use the "Make Visible" and "Make Invisible" buttons.
The "All Visible" and "All Invisible" buttons work on the entire set.
<P>
Note that the layers are listed in order of height, and that you can select multiple entries in the list by using
the Shift key.
This means that you can easily control visibility by depth in the chip.
<P>
Two buttons in the middle control the <I>highlighting</I> of layers.
By selecting a layer and clicking "Toggle Highlight", it makes that layer stand out on the display.
Use "Unhighlight All" to return to normal layer display.
<P>
The bottom of the dialog lets you choose which of the different types of text will be visible.
These different types of text are described more fully in <A HREF="chap06-08-01.html#chap06-08-01">Section 6-8-1</A>.
<P>
This is a modeless dialog: it can remain up while other editing is being done.
Therefore, you can apply visibility changes with the "Apply" button without dismissing the dialog.

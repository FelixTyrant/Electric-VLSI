<!-- HEADER 4-5: Layer Visibility -->

The nodes and arcs on the display are composed of more basic <I>layers</I>.
By using the <B>Layer Visibility...</B> command of the <B>Windows</B> menu,
you can control which layers are actually drawn.
<P>
A dialog is presented showing the layers in the current technology.
By clicking on a layer entry, that layer's visibility is toggled
(the ">" mark indicates that the layer is visible).
Special buttons let you mark or unmark all of the layers.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
This is a modeless dialog: it can remain up while other editing is being done.
Therefore, you can apply visibility changes with the "Apply" button without dismissing the dialog.
<P>
Besides setting visibility by Electric layers, you can choose different layer sets which work with external layers
(i.e. GDS layers).
When the command finishes, the windows are redrawn.

<P>
The right side of the dialog lets you choose which of the different types of text will be visible.
These different types of text are described more fully in <A HREF="chap06-08.html#chap06-08">Section 6-8</A>.
Note that this side is titled "Text visibility options" which means that these settings are saved,
whereas those on the left side are not.

<!-- HEADER 8-7: Miscellaneous Information -->

<H3>The Miscellaneous Information Cell</H3>
<P>
Each cell in a technology library describes a different aspect of the technology.
The <I>miscellaneous information</I> cell contains technology-wide information.
To see this, use the <B>Edit Miscellaneous Info</B> command of the <B>Technology</B> menu.
Note that this cell is called "factors",
so the same effect could be accomplished by selecting it with the <B>Edit Cell...</B> command of the <B>Cells</B> menu.
<P>
The miscellaneous information cell contains two items:
the value of lambda (the basic grid unit,
measured in internal units), and a full description of the technology.
By highlighting any of these items and using the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:right  Windows:right  Mac:cmd-click">technology edit</A></I> button,
the item can be appropriately modified.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig08-14.png" ALT="Figure 8.14"></CENTER>
<P>
Note that the proper way to set the value of lambda for a technology is by changing this value,
and not by using the <B>Change Units...</B> command of the <B>Technology</B> menu.
The <B>Change Units...</B> command is only going to scale the examples in the technology library,
and will not correctly alter the size of components in the new technology.
<P>
<H3>Transparent Colors</H3>
<P>
Once the layers have been defined,
the color map can be built to describe the transparent colors and all of their combinations.
Use the <B>Edit Colors...</B> command of the <B>Technology</B>
menu to modify all 32 combinations of the five transparent layers.
A color mixing palette is presented in which any of the five transparent layers can be viewed in conjunction with the other four.
It is necessary that exactly five layers be given transparent status
(ten if there are associated pseudo-layers).
This editing facility is the same one that is found in the <B>Edit Colors...</B>
command which modifies the current display (see <A HREF="chap04-06.html#chap04-06">Section 4-6</A>).
<P>
<H3>Design Rules</H3>
<P>
Another piece of information that can be determined,
once the layers have been defined, is the design rules.
Use the <B>Edit Design Rules...</B> command of the <B>Technology</B> menu to see them.
This command displays a dialog similar to the one that modifies rules of existing technologies
(see <A HREF="chap09-02.html#chap09-02">Section 9-2</A> for more on design-rules)

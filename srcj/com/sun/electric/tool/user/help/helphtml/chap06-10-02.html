<!-- HEADER 6-10-2: Manipulating Outlines -->

<TABLE><TR><TD>
To manipulate outline information on the currently highlighted node,
use the <B>Outline Edit</B> subcommand of the <B>Special Function</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
After issuing this command, the
window is highlighted with a blue border.
In this mode, the <I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:left  Windows:left  Mac:click">selection</A></I>
button is used to select and move a point on the outline, and the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:right  Windows:right  Mac:cmd-click">creation</A></I>
button adds a new point after the selected one.
You can also use the left and right arrow keys to move around the outline.
The <B>Erase</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu changes to <B>Erase Point</B>
and deletes the highlighted outline point (so does the Delete key).
The <B>Rotate</B> and <B>Mirror</B> commands change to <B>Rotate about Point</B>
and <B>Mirror about Point</B> which allow the entire node to pivot about the currently selected point.
Finally, the <B>Get Info</B> command of the <B>Info</B> menu changes to <B>Get Outline Info</B>
and displays a dialog which allows precise manipulation of the data.

<P>
When done editing the outline, use the <B>Exit Outline Edit</B> subcommand
(in the same location as <B>Outline Edit</B> was in the <B>Special Function</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu).

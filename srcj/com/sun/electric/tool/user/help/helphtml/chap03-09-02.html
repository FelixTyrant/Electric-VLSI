<!-- HEADER 3-9-2: Reading Libraries -->

<!-- COMMAND File/Open Library... -->
<!-- COMMAND File/Import/Readable Dump... -->

The <B>Open Library...</B> command of the <B>File</B> menu brings a new library into Electric from disk.
These disk files are in a private binary format (that is, not readable outside of Electric).
<P>
Besides Electric libraries,
it is possible to read circuit descriptions that are in other formats with the <B>Import</B> command of the <B>File</B> menu.:
<UL>
<LI><B>Readable Dump...</B> is an Electric-specific format that captures the entire database,
but in an editable text format.
Because it is text, it is slower to read than Electric's binary files,
and takes up more space on disk.
However, it can be transferred between machines more reliably and can be edited if necessary.
</LI>
<LI><B>Text Cell Contents...</B> is used to read a text file into a text cell.
The current window must be a textual view (such as VHDL, Verilog, documentation, etc.)
</UL>

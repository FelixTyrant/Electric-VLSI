<!-- HEADER 3-9-2: Reading Libraries -->

The <B>Open Library...</B> command of the <B>File</B> menu brings a new library into Electric from disk.
These disk files are in a private binary format (that is, not readable outside of Electric).
<P>
Besides Electric libraries,
it is possible to read circuit descriptions that are in other formats with the <B>Import</B> command of the <B>File</B> menu.
Most of these commands place the data into a new library that has the same name as the disk file.
When reading these files,
it is important that the current technology be set to the one in the file so that proper layer conversion can be done
(use the <B>Change Current Technology...</B> command of the <B>Technology</B> menu).
These formats can be read:
<UL>
<LI><B>Caltech Intermediate Format (CIF)</B> is used to describe integrated circuit layout.
It contains no connectivity, so after the library is read,
it does not know about transistors and contacts: just layers.
Use the <B>CIF Options...</B> subcommand of the <B>IO Options</B> command to affect how CIF is read.
<LI><B>Stream (GDS II)</B> is also used to describe integrated circuit layout.
It contains no connectivity, so after the library is read,
it does not know about transistors and contacts: just layers.
Use the <B>GDS Options...</B> subcommand of the <B>IO Options</B> command to affect how GDS is read.
On Windows, it is possible to select multiple files for input.
If you do this, all of the GDS will be read into the current library.
<LI><B>Electronic Design Interchange Format (EDIF)</B> is used to describe both schematics and layout.
Electric reads EDIF version 2 0 0.
<LI><B>VHDL</B> is a hardware description language that describes the structure of a circuit.
When VHDL is read, it is not converted to layout,
but instead is placed into a text cell with the {vhdl} view.
<LI><B>Library Exchange Format (LEF)</B> is an interchange format that describes the cells in a library.
The cells that are read in contain ports, but very little contents.
<LI><B>Design Exchange Format (DEF)</B> is an interchange format that describes the contents of a library.
DEF input often makes use of associated LEF files which must already have been read.
Use the <B>DEF Options...</B> subcommand of the <B>IO Options</B> command to affect how DEF is read.
<LI><B>AutoCAD DXF</B> is a solid-modeling interchange format,
and so it may contain 3D objects that cannot be read into Electric.
Nevertheless, Electric creates a library of artwork primitives as well as it can
(you must switch to the Artwork technology before importing DXF).
Use the <B>DXF Options...</B> subcommand of the <B>IO Options</B> command to affect how DXF is read.
<LI><B>Standard Delay Format (SDF)</B> is used to read test vector parameters and place them on cells in the current library.
Before this data can be used by the simulator, one of the three sets
(<B>Typical</B>, <B>Minimum</B>, or <B>Maximum</B>) must be selected with the <B>Annotate Delay Data (ALS)</B>
subcommand of the <B>Simulate</B> command of the <B>Tools</B> menu.
<LI><B>Schematic User Environment (SUE)</B> is a schematic editor that captures a single cell in each file.
The circuitry in SUE files is added to the current library instead of being placed in its own library
(because many SUE files may have to be read to build up a single Electric library).
<LI><B>Readable Dump</B> is an Electric-specific format that captures the entire database,
but in an editable text format.
Because it is text, it is slower to read than Electric's binary files,
and takes up more space on disk.
However, it can be transferred between machines more reliably and can be edited if necessary.

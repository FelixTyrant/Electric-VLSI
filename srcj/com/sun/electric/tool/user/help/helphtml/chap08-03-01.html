<!-- HEADER 8-3-1: Well and Substrate Checking -->

To check the well and substrate layers, use the <B>Analyze Wells</B> subcommand of the <B>Electrical Rules</B>
command of the <B>Tools</B> menu.
This does a more thorough job of checking the layers than the design-rule checker.
This may take some time, and if it takes too long, you can abort it with the interrupt key
(see <A HREF="chap01-09.html#chap01-09">Section 1-9</A>).
<P>
After analysis is done, you can review the errors by typing "&gt;" to see the next error and "&lt;" to see the previous error.
You can also see the list of errors in the Cell Explorer
(see <A HREF="chap03-07.html#chap03-07">Section 3-7</A>).
<P>

The Well Checker makes sure that there are well contacts in every area of well.
You can relax this restriction with the <B>Well Check Options...</B> command.
This dialog allows you to request that there be only 1 well contact,
anywhere on the chip.
You can also instruct the checker to ignore contacts entirely.

<P>
The Well Checker also checks spacing rules between well areas.
Although this is generally the domain of the Design Rule Checker, it is not done there,
so it is done here.
<P>
The Well Checker also checks that there is a connection to power and ground in the appropriate places.
You can disable these checks in the <B>Well Check Options...</B> dialog.
<P>
An additional well check is to find the farthest distance from a substrate contact to the edge of that area.
This check takes more time to do.
<P>
Finally, the Well Checker reports the maximum distance from a well contact to any point on the well.
This is useful when making sure that there are sufficient contacts for each area.

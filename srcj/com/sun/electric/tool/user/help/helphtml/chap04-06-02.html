<P>
When changing the background color,
note that it must contrast with both the highlight color and the inverse of the highlight color
(the inverse is black in the default settings).
<P>
Electric has three different color schemes which have predefined colors.
The subcommands of the <B>Color Schemes</B> command of the <B>Window</B> menu let you switch between them.
With the <B>Black Background Colors</B> subcommand, the background becomes black;
with the <B>White Background Colors</B> subcommand, the background becomes white;
With the <B>Restore Default Colors</B> subcommand, the background becomes gray (the default).

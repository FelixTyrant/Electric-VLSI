The first color control is the "Colors" preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Display" section, "Colors" tab).
The top half of the dialog lists all possible things that can have their color changed:
<UL>
<LI>The transparent colors (all layers drawn transparently are listed).</LI>
<LI>The opaque layers.</LI>
<LI>Special colors such as the background, text, waveform windows, etc.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
When changing the background color,
note that it must contrast with both the highlight color and the inverse of the highlight color
(the inverse is black in the default settings).
<P>
Electric has three different color schemes which have predefined colors.
The commands of the <B>Window / Color Schemes</B> menu let you switch between them.
With the <B>Black Background Colors</B> command, the background becomes black;
with the <B>White Background Colors</B> command, the background becomes white;
with the <B>Restore Default Colors</B> command, the background becomes gray (the default).

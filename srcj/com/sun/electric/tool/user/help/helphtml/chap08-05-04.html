<!-- HEADER 8-5-4: Maze Routing -->

<!-- COMMAND Tool/Routing/Maze Route -->

The maze router replaces unrouted arcs with actual geometry.
To run it, use <B>Maze Route</B> command (in menu <B>Tool / Routing</B>).
If networks are selected when the command is issued, those networks are routed.
If no networks are selected, the all unrouted ares are routed.
<P>
Note that maze routing is done one wire at a time, and may fail if no path can be found.
Therefore it may be preferable to route the unrouted wires one-at-a-time in order to better control the process.
<P>
Note also that maze routing constructs an array which is the size of the circuit,
and searches the array for a routing path.
Therefore, long wires will use large amounts of memory and time.
<P>
For an example of maze routing, open the library file "samples.txt" and edit the cell "tool-RoutingMaze"
(you can read the library with the <B>Readable Dump</B> subcommand of the <B>Import</B> command of the <B>File</B> menu).
This cell has a number of unrouted wires that can be routed.

<!-- HEADER 10-2-2: External References -->

After the header line, all external libraries cells and exports must be declared.
This allows the file reader to quickly find all libraries that will be needed for the design,
and to reconstruct any missing cells and exports.
The cells are listed under their libraries.
The exports are listed under their cells.
If there are multiple external library lines, they are sorted by library name;
where there are multiple external cells in a library, they are sorted by their name;
and where there are multiple external exports in a cell, they are sorted by their name.
<P>
The syntax of an external library reference is:
<P>
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="90%">
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><B>L&lt;name&gt; | &lt;path&gt;</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="20%">&lt;name&gt;</TD><TD WIDTH="80%">the name of the external library.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;path&gt;</TD><TD>the full path to the disk file with the library.</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
The name of the library is used in JELIB file to references to this library.
The actual name of this library is obtained from the path.
<P>
The syntax of an external cell reference is:
<P>
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="90%">
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><B>R&lt;name&gt; | &lt;lowX&gt; | &lt;highX&gt; | &lt;lowY&gt; | &lt;highY&gt; | &lt;creation&gt; | &lt;revision&gt;</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="20%">&lt;name&gt;</TD><TD WIDTH="80%">the name of the external cell.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;lowX&gt;</TD><TD>the low X bounds of the cell contents.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;highX&gt;</TD><TD>the high X bounds of the cell contents.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;lowY&gt;</TD><TD>the low Y bounds of the cell contents.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;highY&gt;</TD><TD>the high Y bounds of the cell contents.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;creation&gt;</TD><TD>the creation date of the cell (Java format).</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;revision&gt;</TD><TD>the revision date of the cell (Java format).</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
The Java format for dates (the creation and revision dates) is in milliseconds since the "epoch"
(Midnight on January 1, 1970, GMT).

The syntax of an external export reference is:
<P>
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="90%">
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><B>F&lt;name&gt; | &lt;centerX&gt; | &lt;centerY&gt;</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="20%">&lt;name&gt;</TD><TD WIDTH="80%">the name of the external export.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;centerX&gt;</TD><TD>the X coordinate of the center of export polygon.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;centerY&gt;</TD><TD>the Y coordinate of the center of export polygon.</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

Examples:
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>Lspiceparts|/home/strubin/electric/spiceparts.jelib</CODE><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>Rgate;1{sch}|-4|4|0|2|1092185029000|1092185060000</CODE><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>Fout|0|2</CODE>
<P>
Declares that an external library called "spiceparts" will be used by the current library, and that it can be found at
"/home/strubin/electric/spiceparts.jelib".
In that library is a cell called "gate;1{sch}" whose contents run from –4 to 4 in X and 0 to 2 in Y.
In that cell is an export called "out" with center at (0,2).

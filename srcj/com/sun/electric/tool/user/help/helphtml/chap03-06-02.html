<!-- HEADER 3-6-2: Export Information -->

Exports are selected by clicking on their text,
or by clicking on the node from which they are exported.
If a very dense design makes export selection hard,
you can choose from a list by using the <B>Select Object...</B>
subcommand of the <B>Selection</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Once a port has been exported,
its characteristics can be modified by selecting the export name and using the <B>Object Properties...</B>
subcommand of the <B>Properties</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
You can change basic export information such as the name, characteristic, and reference name (if applicable).
You can also change the appearance of the export by editing the size, font, style, anchor point, and rotation of the name.
See <A HREF="chap06-08-01.html#chap06-08-01">Section 6-8-1</A> for more about text appearance.

<P>
Buttons at the bottom of the Export Get Info dialog allow you to examine related objects.
The "Highlight Owner" button shows the node on which this export resides,
and the "Attributes" button brings up an Attributes dialog for the export
(see <A HREF="chap06-08-05.html#chap06-08-05">Section 6-8-5</A> for more on Attributes).
<P>
You can change the characteristics of many exports by selecting them and using the <B>Object Properties...</B>
subcommand of the <B>Properties</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
This multi-object dialog has a "For all selected exports:"
 popup that will change all export characteristics at once.
You can change the name of exports by using the <B>Rename Export...</B> command of the <B>Export</B> menu.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
Ports and exports can be displayed on the screen in many different ways.
To control this, use the <B>Preferences...</B> command of the <B>File</B> menu and select the
"Ports/Exports" tab of the "Display" section.
The dialog offers three options for ports and exports:
"Full Names" shows full text names,
"Short Names" shows port and export names only up to the first nonalphabetic character,
and "Crosses" shows crosses at the locations.
</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig03-09.png" ALT="Figure 3.9"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
With short names, the exports "Power-left" and "Power-1" are both written as "Power,"
which allows multiple exports with the same functionality but different names to be displayed as if they have the same name.
To remove port display completely, use the <B>Layer Visibility...</B> command of the <B>Window</B> menu.
In this dialog are options on the right to make ports or exports completely invisible.

<!-- HEADER 3-6-2: Export Information -->

Exports are selected by clicking on their text,
or by clicking on the node from which they are exported.
If a very dense design makes export selection hard,
you can choose from a list by using the Cell Explorer's contents view (see <A HREF="chap03-07.html#chap03-07">Section 3-7</A>)
or by using the <B>Select Export...</B>
subcommand of the <B>Selection</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Once a port has been exported,
its characteristics can be modified by selecting the export name and using the <B>Get Info</B>
command of the <B>Info</B> menu.
You can change basic export information such as the name, characteristic, and reference name (if applicable).
You can also change the appearance of the export by editing the size, font, style, placement, and rotation of the name.
See <A HREF="chap06-08.html#chap06-08">Section 6-8</A> for more about text appearance.

<P>
Buttons at the bottom of the Export Get Info dialog allow you to examine related objects.
The "See Node" button shows the node on which this export resides,
and the "Node Info" button brings up a <B>Get Info</B> dialog for that node.
The "Attributes" button brings up an Attributes dialog for the export
(see <A HREF="chap06-08.html#chap06-08">Section 6-8</A> for more on Attributes).
<P>
You can change the characteristics of many exports by selecting them and setting the "For all selected exports:"
popup in the <B>Get Info</B> dialog of the <B>Info</B> menu.
You can change the name of exports by using the <B>Rename Export...</B> command of the <B>Export</B> menu.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
Ports and exports can be displayed on the screen in many different ways.
The <B>Port and Export Options...</B> command of the <B>Export</B> menu provides three options:
"Full Export Names" shows full text names,
"Short Export Names" shows export names only up to the first nonalphabetic character,
and "Exports as Crosses" shows crosses at the locations.
</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig03-09.png" ALT="Figure 3.9"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
With short names, the exports "Power-left" and "Power-1" are both written as "Power,"
which allows multiple exports with the same functionality but different names to be displayed as if they have the same name.
To remove port display completely, use the <B>Layer Visibility</B> command of the <B>Windows</B> menu.

<h3> Operation Section </h3>

The "Operation" section allows you to select what kind of NCC operation
to perform.  You can either compare hierarchically, compare flat, or
list all the NCC annotations in the design.  
<p>
We recommend hierarchical over flat comparison because hierarchical
comparisons are faster and the mismatch diagnostics are much more
precise and intelligible. However, transistor size checking of
schematics with automatically sized transistors does not work with
hierarchical comparisons. If you select "Check transistor sizes" and
your schematics include automatically sized transistors you must also
select "Flat Comparison".
</p>
<p>
The best way to use NCC is to initially perform all your comparisons
hierarchically. This will typically require many iterations.  Once you
have gotten your designs to pass hierarchical comparison, turn on size
checking and flat comparison.  This will report transistor size
mismatches.

<h3> Size Checking Section </h3>

The "Size Checking" section controls the checking of transistor widths
and lengths.
<p>
NCC does the following when size checking is enabled. After each
topological comparison, NCC checks if it found any topological
mismatches. If NCC found no mismatches then NCC checks, for each pair
of matching transistors, that the widths and lengths are approximately
equal.
</p>
<p>
The two tolerance boxes allow the user to specify how much more the
larger of the two matched transistors may be than the smaller before
NCC reports a size mismatch. The "Relative size tolerance" box
specifies the difference in percentage. The "Absolute size tolerance"
box specifies the difference in units.  NCC reports a size mismatch
when both tolerances are exceeded.
<p>
If you enable "Size Checking" and "Hierarchical Comparison"
simultaneously then NCC restricts which Cells it treats
hierarchically to ensure a correct answer in the presence of
automatically sized transistors. For this case it compares a pair of Cells
hierarchically if and only if each Cell is instantiated exactly once.
</p>

<h3> Checking All Cells Section </h3>

In hierarchical mode NCC attempts to compare all cells in the design
starting with those at the leaves and working it's way toward the root.
For that mode it is often best if NCC stops as soon as it finds a
mismatch. To get this behavior the user should check the box: "Halt
after finding the first mismatched cell".
<p>
However, it is occasionally useful to continue checking even after
mismatches have been detected.  For example, the designer might find
that although cell ABC mismatches, she is unable to fix ABC because
someone else designed it.  When asked to continue, NCC will do the
following when comparing cells that use ABC: 
<ul>
<li>
If NCC found no export mismatches when comparing ABC then NCC will use
the export names to identify corresponding ports in the layout and
schematic. 
</li>
<li> If NCC found export mismatches when comparing ABC then NCC will
flatten the one level of hierarchy: ABC, before performing the
comparison.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The check box "Don't recheck cells that have passed in this Electric
run" skips the checking of a pair of cells if they have ever passed in
this run of Electric.  Because this command <i>is not</i> smart enough
to recheck the cells after either have changed, this command is of
very limited utility.  At the moment NCC has run sufficiently fast
that it doesn't seem worth the effort to implement anything more
sophisticated.

<h3> Reporting Progress Section</h3>

This panel controls how verbose NCC is in reporting its progress. Most
users should leave this at 0.

<h3> Error Reporting Section</h3>

The error reporting section controls how many error messages are printed
when the Local Partitioning algorithm has failed to find a mismatch
but the Gemini algorithm has.  Most users will want to leave these at
the default setting of 10.

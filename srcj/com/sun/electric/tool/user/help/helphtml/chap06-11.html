<!-- COMMAND Tool/Languages/Run Java Bean Shell Script -->

Electric has the Bean Shell built into it.
This enables you to load Java scripts that access the Electric database.
<P>
The Bean Shell is not part of the default Electric distribution.
You must add it as a "plug in"
(see <A HREF="chap01-04.html#chap01-04">section 1-4</A> for more on plug ins).
<P>
To run a script, use the <B>Run Java Bean Shell Script</B> command
(in menu <B>Tool / Languages</B>).

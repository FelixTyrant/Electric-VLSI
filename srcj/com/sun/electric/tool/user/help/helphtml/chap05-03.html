<!-- HEADER 5-3: Setting Constraints -->

The two most common constraints, rigid and fixed-angle, can be controlled from the <B>Arc</B> submenu of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
When the <B>Rigid</B>, <B>Non Rigid</B>,
<B>Fixed Angle</B>, and <B>Not Fixed Angle</B> commands are issued,
all of the currently highlighted arcs have those constraints set.
<P>
In order to set slidability,
select a single arc and issue the <B>Object Properties...</B> subcommand of the
<B>Properties</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.

<TABLE><TR><TD>
At the bottom of the arc properties dialog are check boxes that control constraints.
This is the only way to affect the slidable constraint
 (which is not very commonly used).

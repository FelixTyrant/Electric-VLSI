<!-- HEADER 5-3: Setting Constraints -->

The two most common constraints, rigid and fixed-angle, can be controlled from the <B>Arc</B> menu.
When the <B>Rigid</B>, <B>Non-Rigid</B>,
<B>Fixed-angle</B>, and <B>Not Fixed-angle</B> commands are issued,
all of the currently highlighted arcs have those constraints set.
<P>
In order to set other constraints,
a single arc must be selected and the <B>Get Info</B> command issued from the <B>Info</B> menu.

<TABLE><TR><TD>
In the bottom-right corner of the arc information dialog are four check boxes that control constraints.
This is the only way to affect the slidable constraint
(which is not very commonly used).
Also settable in this dialog is the temporary-rigidity constraint which indicates that an arc will act rigid or nonrigid for the next change only,
after which it will revert to its previous constraint state.

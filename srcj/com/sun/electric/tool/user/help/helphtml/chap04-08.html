<!-- HEADER 4-8: The Cell Explorer -->

The Cell Explorer resides on the left side of every window and
shows a hierarchical "explorer" tree with useful information.
<P>
The explorer window has 3 sections: the LIBRARIES, JOBS, and ERRORS.

<TABLE><TR><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig03-16.png" ALT="Figure 3.16"></CENTER></TD><TD>
The LIBRARIES section of the explorer lists all libraries and cells.
You can examine them in three different ways:
<UL>
<LI><B>Alphabetically</B> all cells are listed alphabetically.</LI>
<LI><B>By group</B> all cells are listed alphabetically, but are also organized into cell groups.</LI>
<LI><B>By hierarchy</B> only the "top level" cells of each library
 are listed
(top level cells are those that are not used as instances in any other cells).
Inside of a cell are the subcells that comprise it, along with the number of times that that cell appears.</LI>
</UL>
To change the view, right-click on the LIBRARIES icon and choose a view.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
The second section of the explorer is the JOBS section.
Here are listed all running tasks in Electric.
The section is usually empty, but if multiple jobs are running at the same time,
you can examine them and manipulate them.
<P>
The third part of the Cell Explorer is the ERRORS section.
This lists all errors that were generated by other tools (DRC, ERC, NCC, etc.)
and which are normally presented with the "&lt;" and "&gt;" keys.
<P>
Many special functions can be done in the cell explorer.
You can double-click on any cell name to see that cell in the right half of the window.
There are special context menus available by right-clicking on an entry
(use command-click on the Macintosh).

<!-- HEADER 6-8-6: Cell Parameters -->

Parameters are special types of attributes that communicate information down the hierarchy,
from a cell instance to its contents.
One example of the use of cell parameters is in the SPICE primitives where user-defined values (such as voltage)
are communicated into the icon for generation in the SPICE deck (see <A HREF="chap09-04.html#chap09-04">Section 9-4</A>).
<P>
Another use of cell parameters is to parameterize the size of a transistor in a schematic
(or to parameterize the scalable layout transistors in the MOSIS CMOS technology, see <A HREF="chap07-05.html#chap07-05">Section 7-5</A>)
The transistor width and length can be defined in terms of the parameter value,
allowing a single cell to take on many different forms.
By combining these parameters with the interpretive language facility,
an arbitrary mathematical expression can be placed on the transistor which combines parameter values to form the exact transistor size
(see <A HREF="chap11-01.html#chap11-01">Section 11-1</A> for more on interpretive languages).
<P>
Parameters are created with the <B>Attributes...</B> subcommand of the <B>Attributes</B> command of the <B>Info</B> menu.
The dialog shows the existing parameters, and allows you to create and delete them.
Each parameter has a default value that will be used if no instance value can be found.
You can also set the type of electrical unit that this parameter describes (capacitance, cesistance, etc.)
See section <A HREF="chap07-02.html#chap07-02">Section 7-2</A> for more on these units.
<P>
Cell parameters are implemented as inheritable attributes.
Inheritble attributes are automatically placed on each newly-created node instance
(thus, they are inherited from the prototype to the instance).
Inside of the cell, the parameter is shown with its name, default value, and actual value from up the hierarchy.
For example, the parameter defined in the above dialog will appear in the cell as the string "Strength=?;def=2".
This means that the actual value from up the hierarchy is not known ("?") but the default is 2.
<P>
When an instance of this cell is created, a new attribute will be placed on it with the default value.
In this example, the instance will have the text "Strength=2" on it.
Since this attribute is separate from the defining one in the cell, you can edit and change its value.
Besides clicking on the text to edit the value,
you can also see all parameters on a node by selecting the "Parameters" button in the node's <B>Get Info</B> dialog.
Once an instance is created with a parameter value, you can descend the hierarchy from that instance and see
the actual parameter value inside of the cell.
So, if you changed the instance text to read "Strength=15", then descending into the cell will show the string
"Strength=15;def=2".
<P>
A parameter, defined in a cell, always appears on every instance of that cell.
If you have added a parameter after creating instances, use the <B>Update Inheritance</B>
or <B>Update Inheritance All Libraries</B> commands.
<P>
In schematics, the location of a parameter on an icon is determined by the location of that parameter on the sample icon,
inside of the schematic cell.
If you make changes to the parameter locations on the sample icon,
you can propagate those changes to icon instances with the commands
<B>Update Locations</B> (updates only the selected icon instances) or <B>Update Locations All Libraries</B>
(updates all icon instances).
<P>
If you do not wish to see a parameter's text on any instance, select the parameter text inside of the cell,
use <B>Get Info</B> from the <B>Info</B> menu, and check "Visible only inside cell".
To override the visibility of cell parameters on an instance, use the <B>See All Parameters on Node</B>,
<B>Hide All Parameters on Node</B>, and <B>Default Parameter Visibility</B> subcommands of the
<B>Attributes</B> command of the <B>Info</B> menu.
These commands make all parameters visible, invisible, or back to their default as specified in the cell.

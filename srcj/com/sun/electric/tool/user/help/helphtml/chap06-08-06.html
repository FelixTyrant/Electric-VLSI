<!-- HEADER 6-8-6: Cell Parameters -->

When attributes are created on cells, they become parameters to that cell.
Each instance of the cell has a copy of the attribute placed on the node, and the node's attribute
can then be set independently of the cell's attribute.
In such a situation, the node attribute's value is the "actual" parameter to the cell,
and the cell attribute's value if the "formal", or default parameter value.
<P>
One example of the use of cell parameters is in the SPICE primitives where user-defined values (such as voltage)
are communicated into the icon for generation in the SPICE deck (see <A HREF="chap08-04-04.html#chap08-04-04">Section 8-4-4</A>).
<P>
Another use of cell parameters is to parameterize the size of a transistor in a schematic
(or to parameterize the scalable layout transistors in the MOSIS CMOS technology, see <A HREF="chap07-04-02.html#chap07-04-02">Section 7-4-2</A>)
The transistor width and length can be defined in terms of the parameter value,
allowing a single cell to take on many different forms.
By combining these parameters with the interpretive language facility,
an arbitrary mathematical expression can be placed on the transistor which combines parameter values to form the exact transistor size
.
<P>
Inside of the cell, the parameter is shown with its name, default value, and actual value from up the hierarchy.
When first defined, the parameter has no actual value, and so appears as "Strength=?;def=2"
(for an attribute called "Strength" with a value of 2).
If an instance is created and its "Strength" attribute is set to 7, then descending into that cell will show "Strength=7;def=2".
<P>
In schematics, the location of a parameter on an icon is determined by the location of that parameter on the sample icon,
inside of the schematic cell.
<P>
If you do not wish to see a parameter's text on any instance, select the parameter text inside of the cell,
use the <B>Object Properties...</B> subcommand of the <B>Properties</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu, and check "Invisible outside cell".

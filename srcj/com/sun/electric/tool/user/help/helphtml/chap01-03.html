<!-- HEADER 1-3: Requirements -->

Electric is written in the Java programming language and is distributed as a single ".jar" file,
typically called "electric.jar".
There are two variations on the ".jar" file: with or without source code.
Either form can run Electric, but the source-code form is larger because it also has
all of the Java code.
<P>
Electric requires Java version 1.3 or later.
It has been tested with Java version 1.5.

<P>
One problem with Java is that the Java Virtual Machine has a memory limit.
This limit prevents programs from growing too large, and speeds up garbage collection.
However, it prevents large circuits from being edited.
If Electric runs out of memory, you can request that more be used.
To do this, use "General" preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "General" section, "General" tab).
At the bottom of the dialog is a memory limit field.
You will have to quit Electric and restart it for the new memory limit to take effect.

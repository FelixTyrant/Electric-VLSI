<!-- HEADER 4-4-2: Panning -->

Besides scaling, you can also pan the window contents,
shifting it about on the display.
This is typically done with the sliders on the right and bottom of the window.
On Windows systems that have a mouse wheel, you can use that to pan vertically
(and hold the shift key while rolling the mouse wheel to pan horizontally).
<P>
In addition to these methods, panning can also be done from menu commands.
The <B>Left</B>, <B>Right</B>, <B>Up</B>,
and <B>Down</B> commands of the <B>Windows</B> menu all shift the window contents appropriately
(and because they are bound to quick keys, these operations can even be done from the keyboard).
By default, these commands shift the screen by about 30% of its size.
You can use the subcommands of the <B>Panning Distance</B> command to change that amount.
The <B>Small</B> subcommand causes subsequent shifts to be about 15% of the screen size.
The <B>Medium</B> subcommand causes subsequent shifts to be about 30% of the screen size.
The <B>Large</B> subcommand causes subsequent shifts to be about 60% of the screen size.
<P>
Another way to pan the window is to drag the cursor to the window edge.
When the edge is hit, the window automatically pans by 10% of its size.
<P>
The <B>Center</B> subcommands of the <B>Windows</B> menu are rarely-used panning commands for shifting the window contents without scaling.
There are two subcommands:
<B>Selection</B> makes the window shift so that the highlighted objects are in the center of the window,
and <B>Cursor</B> makes the window shift so that the current cursor location is in the center of the window.
Note that this second subcommand is useful only when bound to a keystroke,
because you cannot issue the command and have a valid cursor location at the same time.

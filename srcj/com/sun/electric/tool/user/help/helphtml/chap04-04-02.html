Besides scaling, you can also pan the window contents,
shifting it about on the display.
This is typically done with the sliders on the right and bottom of the window.
On systems that have a mouse wheel, you can use that to pan vertically
(and hold the shift key while rolling the mouse wheel to pan horizontally).

You can also use the Pan tool from the tool bar to move the window contents.
This mode can also be invoked with the
<B>Toggle Pan</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Modes / Edit</B>).

In addition to these methods, panning can also be done from menu commands.
The <B>Pan Left</B>, <B>Pan Right</B>, <B>Pan Up</B>,
and <B>Pan Down</B> commands (in menu <B>Window</B>) all shift the window contents appropriately
(and because they are bound to quick keys, these operations can even be done from the keyboard).
By default, these commands shift the screen by about 30% of its size.
You can use the "General" preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "General" section, "General" tab),
to change that amount.
The <B>Small</B> panning distance causes subsequent shifts to be about 15% of the screen size.
The <B>Medium</B> panning distance causes subsequent shifts to be about 30% of the screen size.
The <B>Large</B> panning distance causes subsequent shifts to be about 60% of the screen size.
<P>
The <B>Center</B> commands (in menu <B>Window</B>) are rarely-used panning commands for shifting the window contents without scaling.
There are two commands:
<B>Selection</B> makes the window shift so that the highlighted objects are in the center of the window,
and <B>Cursor</B> makes the window shift so that the current cursor location is in the center of the window.
Note that this second command is useful only when bound to a keystroke,
because you cannot issue the command and have a valid cursor location at the same time.

<P>
One final command is useful if the display appears incorrect.
you can redraw it with the <B>Redisplay Window</B> command (in menu <B>Window</B>) redraws the window.

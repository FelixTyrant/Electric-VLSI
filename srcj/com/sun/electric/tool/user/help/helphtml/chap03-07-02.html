<TABLE><TR><TD>
The <B>Graphically, Entire Library</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Cell Info</B>)
displays a graph of every cell in the library.
The <B>Graphically, From Current Cell</B> command displays a graph that places the current cell at the top.
These commands create a graph of the cell hierarchy.
This graph is actually a new cell, called "CellStructure",
built from Artwork nodes, and stored with the other cells.

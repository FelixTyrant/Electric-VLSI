<!-- HEADER 3-7-2: Cell Graphing -->

<TABLE><TR><TD>
The <B>Graphically, Entire Library</B> subcommand displays a graph of every cell in the library.
The <B>Graphically, From Current Cell</B> subcommand displays a graph that places the current cell at the top.
These commands create a graph of the cell hierarchy.
This graph is actually a new cell, called "CellStructure",
built from Artwork nodes, and stored with the other cells.
If you select a name in this graph,
then the <B>Edit Cell...</B> command of the <B>Cells</B> menu defaults to that cell.

<P>
The <B>Edit Documentation View</B> command of the <B>View</B> menu allows you to store arbitrary text with the cell.
The text editing window that appears can contain any information.
See <A HREF="chap04-10.html#chap04-10">Section 4-10</A> for more on text editing.
<P>
The <B>List Layer Coverage</B> command of the <B>Info</B> menu computes the percentage of the cell that is covered by each layer.
This is useful information for certain fabrication processes which insist on a minimum amount of each layer in the die.

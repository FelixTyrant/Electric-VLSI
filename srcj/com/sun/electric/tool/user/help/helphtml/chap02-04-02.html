<TABLE><TR><TD>
Another way to move a node is to use the <B>Object Properties...</B> command
(in menu <B>Edit / Properties</B>),
and type new X and Y positions.
This dialog allows other modifications to be made as well (orientation, etc.)
<P>
The dialog shows the location of the anchor-point of the node,
which may be in any number of positions (see <A HREF="chap02-02-01.html#chap02-02-01">Section 2-2-1</A>).
</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig02-01.png" ALT="Figure 2.1"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
The dialog also has a field for the node's name.
This name is not related to network information, but it can be used for identification.
If a schematic node is given an arrayed name (such as "and[0:3]") then it indicates that the node is arrayed that many times.
Nodes (and arcs) are automatically be given unique names (such as "nmos@0").
<P>
This dialog is modeless: it can remain on the screen while other editing is being done.
If a different node is selected, the dialog updates to show that node's information.
The "Apply" button changes the selected node to match the new values typed into the dialog.
<P>
The <B>Properties...</B> dialog can also expand to show more information.
When the "More" button is clicked, it grows to full size as shown.
<P>
The full size <B>Properties...</B> dialog has many new controls,
which vary according to the type of node selected:
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
<UL>
<LI>"Expanded" and "Unexpanded" control how the node is drawn (if it is a cell instance).
An expanded instance is one that shows its contents; an unexpanded instance is drawn as a black box.
</LI>
<LI>"Easy to Select" sets whether this node is selectable with a simple click.
This feature allows you to eliminate pieces of circuitry from active editing
(see <A HREF="chap02-01-05.html#chap02-01-05">Section 2-1-5</A>).</LI>
<LI>"Invisible Outside Cell" 
indicates that this node will not be drawn when the current cell is viewed from higher-up the hierarchy.
</LI>
<LI>"Locked" nodes may not be changed (moved, deleted).
</LI>
</UL>
</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig02-13.png" ALT="Figure 2.13"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
The bottom of the expanded Properties... dialog has a scroll area that can view "Ports" or "Attributes".
By default, a list of the node's ports is shown, including any exports, connections, and highlight details.
If the "Attributes" button is selected, the list shows the attributes on the node.
When "Attributes" is selected, the entries in the list let you modify individual values,
and the "Attributes" button brings up an extended dialog for them.
<P>
<!-- NEED 4in -->
If many objects are selected,
you can move them by a specific distance with the <B>Move Objects By...</B>
command (in menu <B>Edit / Move</B>).
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig02-12.png" ALT="Figure 2.12"></CENTER></TD><TD>
If many nodes are selected, the <B>Properties...</B> command will list all of them,
and allow position and size changes to be made at once to each in the group.
If a position and size value appears in the dialog,
it means that this value is the same on every selected node.
If the field is blank, it means that there are different values.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Changes are only made in the fields where you type a value.
To remove an item from the list (not the circuit, just this list) use the "Remove" button.
To remove all but the selected item, use "Remove Others".
If only two objects are selected, this dialog shows the distance between their centers.
<P>
The multi-object <B>Properties...</B> dialog also allows you to change selection style with the "For everything:" popup
(see <A HREF="chap02-01-05.html#chap02-01-05">Section 2-1-5</A> for more on selection styles).
When many exports are selected,
the dialog allows you to change their characteristics with the "For all selected exports:" popup
(see <A HREF="chap03-06-01.html#chap03-06-01">Section 3-6-1</A> for more on exports).

<!-- HEADER 9-2-1: Incremental DRC -->

<!-- PREFERENCE Tools/DRC -->

The incremental design-rule checker is always running, examining your work,
and issuing error messages when an error is detected.
<P>
To control the DRC,
use the DRC Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "DRC" tab).
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
By default, the incremental design-rule checker is on.
To turn it off, uncheck the "On" checkbox in the "Incremental DRC" section.
<P>
The hierarchical checker can save time by reporting fewer errors.
"Report just 1 error per cell" tells you which cells are clean and which have at least 1 error.
You can then recheck those cells for a full report.
"Report just 1 error per pair of geometries" stops checking when any part of a node or arc has an error.
This is often sufficient for correcting other errors as well.

<P>
The design-rule checker remembers the date of the last clean check.
If a cell has not changed since then, it does not need to be rechecked.
This date information can be stored in the libraries (requiring them to be saved)
or can be held only in Electric's memory (requiring them to be rechecked if Electric is restarted).
You can also request that all date information be removed so that a full recheck is done.
<P>
MOS contact nodes automatically increase the number of cuts when they grow larger
(see <A HREF="chap07-04-01.html#chap07-04-01">Section 7-4-1</A>).
Because of this,
very large contact nodes can create excessive work for the design-rule checker as it examines each of the cuts.
To save time, check the "Ignore center cuts in large contacts" check box,
which will examine only the cut layers around the edges of contact nodes.
<P>
DRC rules for new technologies might require special rules, which can be time consuming.
To ignore these errors, check "Ignore area checking" (for minimum area rules) and
"Ignore extension rules" (for special overlap rules).
<P>
After analysis of the circuit,
you can review the errors by typing "&gt;" and "&lt;" to step to the next and previous error that was found.
You can also see a list of errors in the cell explorer (see <A HREF="chap04-08.html#chap04-08">Section 4-8</A>).
If you wish to see errors while DRC is running, check "Interactive logging",
and the errors will appear incrementally.

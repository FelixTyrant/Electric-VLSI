When instances are initially created, they are drawn as black boxes with nothing inside.
This form of instance display is called <I>unexpanded</I>,
as opposed to <I>expanded</I> display which shows the actual layout inside the instance.
To expand an instance, select it and use the subcommands of the <B>Expand Cell Instances</B>
command of the <B>Cell</B> menu.
The <B>One Level Down</B> subcommand opens up the next closed level;
the <B>All the Way</B> subcommand opens up all levels to the bottom;
and the <B>Specified Amount...</B> lets you type a number of levels of hierarchy to expand.
These commands expand all highlighted cells.
If a highlighted cell is already expanded,
this command expands any subcells inside of the instance, repeatedly down the hierarchy.
<P>
Once expanded,
a cell instance will continue to be drawn with its contents shown until the subcommands of the <B>Unexpand Cell Instances</B>
command are used.
These commands return cell instances to their black-box form,
starting with the deepest subcells that are expanded at the bottom of the hierarchy.
The <B>One Level Up</B> subcommand closes up the bottommost expanded level;
the <B>All the Way</B> subcommand closes all levels from the bottom;
and the <B>Specified Amount...</B> lets you type a number of levels of hierarchy to close.
<P>

You can also use the expansion (opened eye) and unexpansion (closed eye) icons from the tool bar to expand and unexpand by one level.

<P>
The expansion information can also be set or reset by using the <B>Object Properties...</B>
subcommand of the <B>Properties</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu and clicking on the "Expanded" or "Unexpanded" buttons.
<P>
There are times when you want to see the layout inside of a cell instance, but only temporarily.
The <B>Look Inside Highlighted</B> command of the <B>Cell</B> menu displays everything in the highlighted area,
down through all hierarchical levels.
This is a one-shot display that reverts to unexpanded form if the window is shifted, scaled, or redrawn.
<P>
There is a slight difference in specification between the <B>Expand Cell Instances</B>
subcommands and the <B>Look Inside Highlighted</B> command.
The <B>Expand Cell Instances</B> subcommands affect cell instances only,
and thus any instances that are highlighted or in the highlighted area will be completely expanded.
The <B>Look Inside Highlighted</B> command affects layout display in an area,
so only those parts of instances that are inside of the highlighted area will be shown.
Thus, the command <B>Look Inside Highlighted</B> is more precise in what it expands and can be used,
in conjunction with Area selection, to show only a specific part of the circuit
(see <A HREF="chap02-01-03.html#chap02-01-03">Section 2-1-3</A> for more on area selection).

<!-- HEADER 8-2-1: Incremental DRC -->

The incremental design-rule checker is always running, examining your work,
and issuing error messages when an error is detected.
The user should be warned that the incremental design-rule checker does not examine hierarchy.
This means that if a cell instance is used in a circuit,
the incremental design-rule checker does not examine its contents to see how that interacts with other layout surrounding the instance.
To check the complete hierarchy, use the <B>Check Hierarchically</B> subcommand.
<P>
To control the DRC,
use the <B>DRC Options...</B> subcommand of the <B>DRC</B> command of the <B>Tools</B> menu.

By default, the incremental design-rule checker is on.
To turn it off, uncheck the "On" checkbox in the "Incremental DRC" section.
While the tool is off, Electric keeps track of all cells that change.
When the tool is turned back on it rechecks all of those changed cells.
Thus, the incremental design-rule checker can be made into a "batch" tool by keeping it off until circuit layout is complete.
<P>
MOS contact nodes automatically increase the number of cuts when they grow larger
(see <A HREF="chap07-04.html#chap07-04">Section 7-4</A>).
Because of this,
very large contact nodes can create excessive work for the design-rule checker as it examines each of the cuts.
To save time, check the "Ignore center cuts in large contacts" check box,
which will examine only the cut layers around the edges of contact nodes.

After errors have been reported, you can review them by typing "&gt;" and "&lt;" to step to the next and previous error that was found.
If you wish to recheck an entire cell, use the <B>Check this Level Only</B> subcommand.

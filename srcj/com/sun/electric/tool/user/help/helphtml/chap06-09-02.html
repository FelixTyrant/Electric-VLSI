<!-- HEADER 6-9-2: Naming Networks -->
<!-- PREFERENCE Tools/Network -->

Network names are derived from export names and arcs that are named in a cell.
The name given to an export becomes the network name for all arcs connected to that export.
Similarly, the name given to an arc
(by setting the name field in the <B>Object Properties...</B> dialog) becomes the name of the network for all connected arcs.
You can rename a network by changing name of a connected export or arc.
<P>
Two phenomena can occur in network naming: a network can be <I>multiply named</I>,
and it can <I>span disjoint circuitry</I>.
A network has multiple names when two or more connected arcs or exports are named with different names.
For example, if you make an export on a contact node and call it "clock",
then you select an arc connected to that contact node and name it "sig",
the circuitry will be on the network "clock/sig."
Thus, both names now apply to the same network.

The other phenomenon of network naming is that a single network can include unconnected parts of the circuit.
This happens when arcs in unconnected parts of the circuit are given the same name.
This causes the two arcs to be implicitly joined into one network.
Because this network naming phenomena is most commonly used in schematics,
the unification of like-named networks only happens in cells with the "schematic" view.
To cause this same effect in all views (such as "layout"),
use the "Network" preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Network" tab),
and check "Unify all like-named nets".

<P>
You can also use this dialog to request that all networks that start with a particular set of letters be unified.
For example, if the "Unify Networks that start with" field is set to "clk",
then the networks "clk01" and "clkExtra" will be merged into a single network.
Multiple merges can be specified, separated by spaces.
For example, if the field is "pwr gnd" then all nets starting with "pwr" will be merged, and all nets starting with "gnd" will be merged.
<P>
When busses must be automatically generated (during netlisting, for example)
the bus indices can be set to start at 0 or 1, and they can ascend or descend.

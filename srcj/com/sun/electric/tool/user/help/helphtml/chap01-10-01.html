<!-- HEADER 1-10-1: IC Layout Example: Make a Cell -->

This section takes you through the design of some simple IC layout.
The instructions here are also available by using the <B>Tutorial</B> command of the <B>Info</B> menu.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Before you can place any IC layout, the editing window must have a cell in it.
Use the <B>Edit Cell...</B> command in the <B>Cells</B> menu.
This will show a dialog with a list of existing cells (which is empty, because none exist yet).
Click on the "New Cell" button at the bottom of this dialog to create a new cell.
You will then see a dialog which asks you for information about this new cell.

Type the name ("MyCircuit" is used here) and click OK.
The editing window will no longer have the "No cell in this window" message,
and circuitry may now be created.

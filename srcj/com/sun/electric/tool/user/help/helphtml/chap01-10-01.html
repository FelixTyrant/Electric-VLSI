<!-- HEADER 1-10-1: IC Layout Example: Make a Cell -->

This section takes you through the design of some simple IC layout.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Before you can place any IC layout, the editing window must have a cell in it.
Use the <B>New Cell...</B> command in the <B>Cells</B> menu.
This will show a dialog that lets you type a new cell name.
Type the name ("MyCircuit" is used here) and click OK.
The editing window will no longer have the "No cell in this window" message,
and circuitry may now be created.

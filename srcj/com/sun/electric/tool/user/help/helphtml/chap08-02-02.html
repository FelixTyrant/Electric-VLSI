<!-- HEADER 8-2-2: Hierarchical DRC -->

The hierarchical design-rule checker uses the same rules and techniques as the incremental checker,
but it is able to check across levels of hierarchy.
To run it, use the <B>Check Hierarchically</B> subcommand of the <B>DRC</B> command of the <B>Tools</B> menu.
To check only a selected subset of the current cell, use <B>Check Selection Area Hierarchically</B>.
<P>
To help guide the design-rule checker, a "cloaking" layer can be placed over areas that are not to be examined.
This cloaking layer is created by using the <B>DRC Exclusion</B>
subcommand of the <B>New Special Object</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
Any errors that fall inside of this node's area are ignored.
<P>
After analysis of the circuit,
you can review the errors by typing "&gt;" and "&lt;" to step to the next and previous error that was found.
You can also see a list of errors in the Cell Explorer (see <A HREF="chap03-07.html#chap03-07">Section 3-7</A>).
<P>
After a cell has passed Hierarchical DRC with no errors, it is tagged with the current date.
In subsequent runs of the Hierarchical DRC, if the cell has not been modified since that date,
it is not rechecked.
(However, if you change the DRC rules or the technology options, all date information is cleared.)
If you wish to force all cells to be rechecked,
use the "Clear valid DRC dates" button in the <B>DRC Options...</B> dialog.
To see which cells have passed Hierarchical DRC,
use the <B>General Cell Lists...</B> command of the <B>Cells</B> menu
(a "D" is shown in on the right for cells that are DRC current).
<P>
Another way to speed up Hierarchical DRC is to check the "Just 1 error per cell" entry in the
<B>DRC Options...</B> dialog.
This tells the system to stop checking a cell after the first error has been found.
By using this option, you can more quickly determine <I>which</I> cells in the design are correct,
without knowing exactly where the errors lie.
Then, you can go to the cells with errors and do a more complete check.
<P>
If you are fortunate enough to have a computer with more than 1 processor,
the DRC can take advantage of this when doing hierarchical checking.
Check "Use multiple processors" in the <B>DRC Options...</B> dialog and tell it how
many processors to use.
The value of this field sets the number of parallel threads that will be spawned to do the DRC,
so it can be more than the number of processors.

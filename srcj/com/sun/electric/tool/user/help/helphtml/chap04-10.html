<!-- HEADER 4-10: Text Windows -->

<TABLE><TR><TD>
Some cells are textual in nature (VHDL, Verilog, Netlists, or Documentation), and cause text to appear in the edit window.

<P>
When text editing, the standard point-and-click commands apply.
You can use the <B>Cut</B>, <B>Copy</B>, and <B>Paste</B> commands of the <B>Edit</B> menu.

Searching is done with the <B>Find Text...</B> subcommand of the <B>Text</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
You can find and/or replace text with the appropriate buttons.
Check boxes allow the search to be case sensitive and to go in the reverse direction.
In addition, you can jump directly to a specified line number.

<P>
Note the <B>Find Text...</B> command can also be used to find text in a circuit.
<P>
Note that there is no "saving" of text windows because they are editing internal data structures.
Therefore every change updates the information in Electric
(but the library must be saved to truly preserve changes).
<P>
The contents of a text window can be saved to disk with the <B>Text Cell Contents...</B>
subcommand of the <B>Export</B> command of the <B>File</B> menu to save just the text.
Use <B>Text Cell Contents...</B> subcommand of the <B>Import</B> command to read a file into a text window.

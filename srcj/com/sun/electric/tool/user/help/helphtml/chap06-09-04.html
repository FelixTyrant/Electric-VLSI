<!-- HEADER 6-9-4: Power and Ground -->

<!-- COMMAND Tool/Network/Validate Power and Ground -->
<!-- COMMAND Tool/Network/Show Power and Ground -->

Identification of a power network is done by finding:
<UL>
<LI>a Power node from the Schematic technology;
<LI>an export in the current cell that has the "power" characteristic;
<LI>an export in the current cell that begins with the letters "vdd", "vcc",
"pwr", or "power";
<LI>a port on a component in the current cell that has either of the above two properties.
</UL>
Ground networks use the same rules,
except that the acceptable port names begin with "vss", "gnd", or "ground".
<P>
By default,
supply networks defined with the Power and Ground nodes of the Schematic technology are combined into one network.
This means, for example, that two arcs,
each connected to a separate Ground node,
appear on the same network regardless of their actual connectivity in the circuit.
<P>
Although this unification is the proper thing to do for schematics,
it is not always proper for IC layout.
For example, in MOS technologies,
two ports exported with the "power" characteristic are not on the same net unless they are actually connected
(there may be multiple power rails that do not connect).
As a circuit debugging aid to ensure that power and ground networks are properly connected,
Electric can be instructed to unify power and ground networks in ALL technologies, regardless of their actual connectivity.
The "Network" preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Network" tab)
has the "Unify Power and Ground" item which causes all power and ground networks to be combined.
This unification of all supply rails can be disabled by unchecking the menu entry.
By highlighting power and ground networks with and without this option,
designers can see whether all of their supply rails are fully connected.
<P>
As a debugging aid for power and ground networks, the command <B>Show Power and Ground</B>
(in menu <B>Tool / Network</B>) shows the entire power and ground network.
The <B>Validate Power and Ground</B> command checks all power and
 ground networks in the circuit.
Any power or ground networks that are named according to the prefixes listed above must have the proper characteristics.
If, for example, a power network is called "gnd007", then it will be flagged by this command.

<!-- COMMAND Tool/NCC/Schematic and Layout Views of Cell in Current Window -->
<!-- COMMAND Tool/NCC/Cells from Two Windows -->

<P>
To compare two cells, use these commands (in menu <B>Tool / NCC</B>):
<UL>
<LI>
   <B>Schematic and Layout Views of Cell in Current Window</B>

   Use a heuristic to figure out what to compare against the cell in
   the current window.  If the current cell is a schematic then
   compare it against some layout cell in the same cell group.  If the
   current cell is a layout then compare it against some schematic
   cell in the same cell group.  Since most cell groups have one
   layout cell and one schematic cell, this form of the NCC command is
   usually the most convenient.
</LI>
<LI>
   <B>Cells from Two Windows</B>

   Compare the two cells that are displayed in the two opened windows
   (there must be exactly two windows). This is useful when the
   schematic and layout are not in the same cell group. The command
   can also be used to compare schematics with schematics or layout
   with layout. However, the command refuses to compare icon cells
   since icons cells don't have defined connectivity.

</LI>

<li>
	<b> Add NCC Annotation to Cell </b>

	Bring up a sub menu that allows user to select which NCC annotation
	to add to a cell. Note that the dsigner should replace text surrounded 
	by angle brackets: "&lt &gt".
</li>

<li>
    <b>Copy Schematic Names to Layout</b>
    
    For each pair of matching schematic and layout Cells, rename networks 
    in the layout Cell to have the same name as the equivalent networks
    in the schematic Cell. This command only changes the name of layout 
    networks that have no user-assigned names. If a layout network has
    a user-assigned name that does not match the schematic then this 
    command prints a warning. This command also warns when non-equivalent
    networks have the same name. This command uses the network equivalence table
    generated by the most recent run of NCC.
</li>

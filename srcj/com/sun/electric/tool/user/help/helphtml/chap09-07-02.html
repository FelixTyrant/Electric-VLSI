<!-- COMMAND Tool/NCC/Schematic and Layout Views of Cell in Current Window -->
<!-- COMMAND Tool/NCC/Cells from Two Windows -->

<P>
To compare two cells, use these commands (in menu <B>Tool / NCC</B>):
<UL>
<LI>
   <B>Schematic and Layout Views of Cell in Current Window</B>

   Use a heuristic to figure out what to compare against the cell in
   the current window.  If the current cell is a schematic then
   compare it against some layout cell in the same cell group.  If the
   current cell is a layout then compare it against some schematic
   cell in the same cell group.  Since most cell groups have one
   layout cell and one schematic cell, this form of the NCC command is
   usually the most convenient.
</LI>
<LI>
   <B>Cells from Two Windows</B>

   Compare the two cells that are displayed in the two opened windows
   (there must be exactly two windows). This is useful when the
   schematic and layout are not in the same cell group. The command
   can also be used to compare schematics with schematics or layout
   with layout. However, the command refuses to compare icon cells
   since icons cells don't have defined connectivity.

</LI>

<li>
    <b>Copy Schematic Names to Layout</b>
    
    For each pair of matching schematic and layout Cells, rename networks 
    in the layout Cell to have the same name as the equivalent networks
    in the schematic Cell. This command only changes the name of layout 
    networks that have no user-assigned names. If a layout network has
    a user-assigned name that does not match the schematic then this 
    command prints a warning. This command also warns when non-equivalent
    networks have the same name. This command uses the result generated
    by the most recent run of NCC.
    <p>
    Note: This command clears the saved result from the last run of NCC. 
    If you need to run a command that needs the last result, for example
    "Highlight Equivalent", then you must rerun NCC.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
	<b> Highlight Equivalent </b>

	Highlight the network that is equivalent to the currently selected
	network. The user should be aware of a number of limitations:  
	<ol>
	<li> 
		This command only works for networks in the root cells.
	</li>
	<li> 
		Because NCC performs series / parallel combination, NCC
		can't find equivalents for certain networks. For example,
		when NCC merges two series MOS transistors into a single
		NMOS_2STACK it removes the network between them from NCC's
		database. Therefore if you click on that network and ask
		to highlight the equivalent, NCC won't be able to find 
		an equivalent.
	</li>
	<li> 
		NCC merges networks connected by parasitic resistors
		and exportsConnectedByParent annotations. When NCC does this
		it removes all but one of those networks from its database. 
		If you click on one of the removed networks and ask to
		highlight the equivalent, then NCC won't be able to find
		an equivalent.
	</li>
	</ol>
</li>

<li>
	<b> Add NCC Annotation to Cell </b>

	Bring up a sub menu that allows user to select which NCC annotation
	to add to a cell. Note that the designer should replace text surrounded 
	by angle brackets: "&lt &gt". See the "NCC Annotations" section below
	for a description of each NCC annotation.

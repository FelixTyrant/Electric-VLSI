<!-- COMMAND Tool/Generation/Coverage Implants Generator -->
<!-- COMMAND Tool/Generation/ROM Generator... -->
<!-- COMMAND Tool/Generation/MOSIS CMOS PLA Generator... -->
<!-- COMMAND Tool/Generation/Generate gate layouts (MoCMOS) -->

There are other generators built into Electric.
These commands (in menu <B>Tool / Generation</B>) may be used:
<UL>
<LI><B>Coverage Implants Generator</B>
Although individual MOS nodes and arcs have the proper amount of implant around them,
a collection of such objects may result in an irregular implant boundary.
To clean this up, you can place pure-layer nodes of implant that neatly cover the implant area.
This command does it automatically.
It removes previous pieces of coverage implant before running, so that the result is a clean cover.
</LI>

<LI><B>ROM Generator...</B>
The ROM generator constructs many cells to describe a ROM from a personality file.
You will be prompted for the personality file.
The first line of the ROM personality file lists the degree of folding.
For example, a 256-word x 10-bit ROM with a folding degree of 4 will be implemented as a 64 x 40 array
with 4:1 column multiplexers to return 10 bits of data while occupying more of a square form factor.
The number of words and degree of folding should be powers of 2.
The remaining lines of the file list the contents of each word.
The parser is pretty picky.
There should be a carriage return after the list word, but no other blank lines in the file.
Here is a sample ROM file:
<CODE>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;010101
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;011001
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100101
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101010
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;00000000
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10000000
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;01000000
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11000000
</CODE>
</LI>

<LI><B>MOSIS CMOS PLA Generator...</B>
The MOSIS CMOS PLA generator reads two personality files (AND and OR) and
generates a PLA array.
Each file has only two numbers on the first line to define the size of the array,
and the values of the array on subsequent lines.
Both the AND file and the OR file are similar.
Example files can be found in the <B>PLA-ROM</B> subdirectory of the <B>examples</B> directory.
Here is some sample PLA logic:
<CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD>
<I>f</I> = (<I>a</I> <B>and</B> <I>b</I> <B>and</B> (<B>not</B> <I>c</I>)) <B>or</B> ((<B>not</B> <I>b</I>) <B>and</B> (<B>not</B> <I>a</I>))
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>g</I> = (<I>a</I> <B>and</B> <I>c</I>) <B>or</B> ((<B>not</B> <I>a</I>) <B>and</B> (<B>not</B> <I>c</I>))
</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>
Here is the AND file for the above logic:
<PRE>
    4  3
    1  1  0
    0  0  X
    1  X  1
    0  X  0
</PRE>
</LI>

<LI><B>Generate gate layouts (MoCMOS)</B>
Generates a set of gates in the MOSIS CMOS technology.
</LI>

</UL>

<!-- COMMAND Tool/NCC/Schematic and Layout Views of Cell in Current Window -->
<!-- COMMAND Tool/NCC/Cells from Two Windows -->

<P>
To compare two cells, use these commands (in menu <B>Tool / NCC</B>):
<UL>
<LI>
   <B>Schematic and Layout Views of Cell in Current Window</B>

   Use a heuristic to figure out what to compare against the cell in
   the current window.  If the current cell is a schematic then
   compare it against some layout cell in the same cell group.  If the
   current cell is a layout then compare it against some schematic
   cell in the same cell group.  Since most cell groups have one
   layout cell and one schematic cell, this form of the NCC command is
   usually the most convenient.
</LI>
<LI>
   <B>Cells from Two Windows</B>

   Compare the two cells that are displayed in the two opened windows
   (there must be exactly two windows). This is useful when the
   schematic and layout are not in the same cell group. The command
   can also be used to compare schematics with schematics or layout
   with layout. However, the command refuses to compare icon cells
   since icons cells don't have defined connectivity.

<li>
    <b>Copy Schematic Names to Layout</b>
    
    For each pair of matching schematic and layout Cells, rename networks 
    and nodes 
    in the layout Cell to have the same name as the equivalent networks
    in the schematic Cell. This command copies only user-assigned names
    from the schematic to the layout. Furthermore, it only changes the names
    of layout
    networks and nodes 
    that have no user-assigned names. If a layout network 
    or node has
    a user-assigned name that does not match the schematic then this 
    command prints a warning. This command also warns when non-equivalent
    networks or nodes have the same user-assigned name. 
    <p>
    Notes:
    <ul>
    <li>
    This command uses the result 
    generated
    by the most recent run of NCC. That NCC run should be hierarchical 
    without
    size checking.
    </li><li>
    This command clears the saved result from the last run of NCC. 
    If you need to run a command that needs the last result, for example
    "Highlight Equivalent", then you must rerun NCC.
    </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</li>

<li>
	<b> Highlight Equivalent </b>

	Highlight the network or node that is equivalent to the currently 
	selected
	network or node. The user should be aware of a number of limitations:  
	<ol>
	<li>
		This command works best for networks in the top
		level cells compared by the most recent NCC run.
	</li>
	<li>
		This command also works for nodes in the top
		level cells compared by the most recent NCC run as long
		as those nodes are primitive transistors or were treated as
		primitives because NCC compared them hierarchically.
	</li>
	<li> 
		Because NCC combines MOS transistors that are in series 
		into a single NMOS_*STACK,
		NCC
		can't find equivalents for certain networks and nodes. 
		For example,
		when NCC merges two series MOS transistors into a single
		NMOS_2STACK it removes the network between them from NCC's
		database. Therefore if you click on that network and ask
		to highlight the equivalent, NCC won't be able to find 
		an equivalent. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Because NCC combines MOS 
		transistors that are in parallel, it can't find equivalents
		for certain networks and nodes. For example when NCC
		detects two parallel MOS
		transistors, it removes one from NCC's database but adds
		it's width to the other. Therefore if you click
		on the transistor that was discarded and ask to highlight the equivalent, NCC
		won't be able to find an equivalent.
	</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	Note:
	<ul>
	<li>
	    This command uses the result 
	    generated
	    by the most recent run of NCC. 
	 </li>
	 </ul>
</li>

<li>
	<b> Add NCC Annotation to Cell </b>

	Bring up a sub menu that allows user to select which NCC annotation
	to add to a cell. Note that the designer should replace text surrounded 
	by angle brackets: "&lt &gt". See the "NCC Annotations" section below
	for a description of each NCC annotation.

<!-- HEADER 1-5: Plug-Ins -->

Electric plug-ins are additional pieces of code that can be downloaded separately
to enhance the system's functionality.
At this time, these plug-ins are available:
<UL>
<LI><B>Bean Shell</B>
The Bean Shell is used to do parameter evaluation in Electric.
Advanced operations that make use of cell parameters will need this plug-in.
The Bean Shell is available from <A HREF="http://www.beanshell.org">www.beanshell.org</A>.
</LI>
<LI><B>IRSIM</B>
The IRSIM simulator is a gate-level simulator from Stanford University.
It is available from <A HREF="http://www.staticfreesoft.com">www.staticfreesoft.com</A>.
</LI>
<LI><B>3D Viewer</B>
The 3D viewer lets you rotate the integrated circuit and view it as a three-dimensional
interconnection of layers.
Although the viewer is included with Electric, it disables itself if the Java3D package
is not installed.
You can get the Java3D package from
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D">Sun Microsystems</A> or from 
<A HREF="http://www.j3d.org">The Java 3D Community Site</A>.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
To attach a plugin, it must be invoked from the command line by adding it to the classpath.
For example, to add the beanshell (a file named "bsh-2.0b1.jar"), type:
<CENTER><CODE>java -classpath electric.jar:bsh-2.0b1.jar com.sun.electric.Launcher</CODE></CENTER>
<P>
On Windows, you must use the ";" to separate jar files,
and you might also have to quote the collection since ";" separates commands:
<CENTER><CODE>java -classpath "electric.jar;bsh-2.0b1.jar" com.sun.electric.Launcher</CODE></CENTER>
<P>
Note that you must explicitly mention the main Electric class (com.sun.electric.Launcher)
when using plug-ins since all of the jar files are grouped together as the "classpath".

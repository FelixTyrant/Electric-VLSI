<!-- HEADER 1-5: Plug-Ins -->

Electric plug-ins are additional pieces of code that can be downloaded separately
to enhance the system's functionality.
Currently, these plug-ins are available:
<UL>
<LI><B>Bean Shell</B>
The Bean Shell is used to do parameter evaluation in Electric.
Advanced operations that make use of cell parameters will need this plug-in.
The Bean Shell is available from <A HREF="http://www.beanshell.org">www.beanshell.org</A>.
</LI>
<LI><B>IRSIM</B>
The IRSIM simulator is a gate-level simulator from Stanford University.
Although originally written in C, it was translated to Java so that it could plug into Electric.
The Electric version is available from <A HREF="http://www.staticfreesoft.com">Static Free Software</A> at
<A HREF="http://www.staticfreesoft.com/electricIRSIM-8.02.jar">http://www.staticfreesoft.com/electricIRSIM-8.02.jar</A>.
</LI>
<LI><B>3D</B>
The 3D facility lets you rotate an integrated circuit and view it as a three-dimensional
interconnection of layers.
Although most of the viewer is included with Electric, there are extra parts that
can be installed (a 3D rotation control and an animation capture facility).
Also, none of the 3D display can function unless you have installed the
Java3D package from from <A HREF="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</A>.
The 3D extras are available from <A HREF="http://www.staticfreesoft.com">Static Free Software</A> at
<A HREF="http://www.staticfreesoft.com/electricJ3D-8.02.jar">http://www.staticfreesoft.com/electricJ3D-8.02.jar</A>
The Java3D package is available from
<A HREF="http://www.j3d.org">The Java 3D Community Site</A>.

</UL>
<P>
To attach a plugin, it must be invoked from the command line by adding it to the classpath.
For example, to add the beanshell (a file named "bsh-2.0b1.jar"), type:
<CENTER><CODE>java -classpath electric.jar:bsh-2.0b1.jar com.sun.electric.Launcher</CODE></CENTER>
<P>
On Windows, you must use the ";" to separate jar files,
and you might also have to quote the collection since ";" separates commands:
<CENTER><CODE>java -classpath "electric.jar;bsh-2.0b1.jar" com.sun.electric.Launcher</CODE></CENTER>
<P>
Note that you must explicitly mention the main Electric class (com.sun.electric.Launcher)
when using plug-ins since all of the jar files are grouped together as the "classpath".

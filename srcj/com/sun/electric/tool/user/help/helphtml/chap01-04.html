Running Electric varies with the different platforms:
<UL>
<LI><B>UNIX/Linux</B>
Although you may be able to double-click on the icon from some
file managers, the safest way to run Electric is to use a shell window
and type:
<CENTER><CODE>java -jar electric.jar</CODE></CENTER><P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Windows</B>
You can run Electric by double-clicking on the file "electric.jar".
You can also run Electric from a command window by typing:
<CENTER><CODE>java -jar electric.jar</CODE></CENTER><P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Macintosh</B>
Macintosh computers must be running OS 10.3 or later.
You can run Electric by double-clicking on the file "electric.jar".
Note that the dock icon for Electric just looks like a terminal window.
You can also run Electric from a shell window by typing:
<CENTER><CODE>java -jar electric.jar</CODE></CENTER><P>
</LI>

One problem with Java is that the Java Virtual Machine has a memory limit.
This limit prevents programs from growing too large, and speeds up garbage collection.
However, it prevents large circuits from being edited.
If Electric runs out of memory, you can request that more be used.
To do this, use "General" preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "General" tab).
At the bottom of the dialog is a memory limit field.
You will have to quit Electric and restart it for the new memory limit to take effect.

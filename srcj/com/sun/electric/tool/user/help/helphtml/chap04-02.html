<!-- HEADER 4-2: The Messages Window -->

Before describing the commands for controlling the editing windows,
it is useful to mention the messages window,
which contains scrollable text.
<P>
The messages window is the place for all textual information.
If the window is closed, it will go away, but it will reappear whenever messages are displayed.
If this window is obscured by other Electric windows,
it will pop to the top when new information is sent to it.
<P>
The text in the messages window can be selected with the cursor and edited with the <B>Cut</B>, <B>Copy</B>,
and <B>Paste</B> commands of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
You can remove all text with the <B>Clear</B> subcommand of the <B>Messages Window</B> command of the <B>Windows</B> menu.
You can change the font and text size of the messages window with the <B>Set Font...</B>
subcommand of the <B>Messages Window</B> command of the <B>Windows</B> menu
(which has a different format on each platform).
<P>
The text in the messages window can be saved to disk by using the <B>Save Messages</B>
subcommand of the <B>Messages Window</B> command of the <B>Windows</B> menu
(the text is saved in the file "emessages.txt").
<P>
The location of the messages window can be saved with your options by using the <B>Save Window Location</B>
subcommand of the <B>Messages Window</B> command of the <B>Windows</B> menu.
This command is not needed on the Macintosh,
because all changes to Macintosh windows are remembered without request.

Electric has the concept of a <I>current technology</I> which is shown in the
status bar.
This technology affects many things, including the selection of nodes and arcs in the component menu.
There are a number of ways to affect the current technology, both manual and automatic.
<P>
You can change the current technology by selecting it from the popup at the top of the
side bar (either the "Components" or "Layers" tab).
Electric automatically switches the current technology to match the cell being edited.
If there are multiple cells being edited from different technologies, this switching can become annoying.
To disable automatic technology switching,
use the "Nodes" preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "General" section, "Nodes" tab),
and uncheck "Switch technology to match current cell".
<P>
To see a list of primitive nodes and arcs in the current technology,
use the <B>Describe this Technology</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Technology Specific</B>).
To see a detailled description of the current technology,
use the <B>Document Current Technology</B> command.

<TABLE><TR><TD>
The Technology Project Settings command (in menu <B>File / Project Settings...</B>, "Technology" tab)
lets you control many general and specific technology settings.

<UL>
<LI>"Startup technology" controls the technology that is used when Electric first begins.
It is also used when reading old libraries that are missing some technology information.</LI>
<LI>"Layout technology to use for Schematics" sets the technology to use for real geometry
(an integrated circuit technology, not a schematics or artwork technology).
The default layout technology is used to give further information about schematics components.</LI>
<LI>"Current foundry" sets specific rules that customize a technology for a given manufacturer.
This field is currently not used.</LI>

Some technologies have settings that further customize them.
These settings are found in the Technology Project Settings dialog (above)
and the Technology Preferences dialog
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Technology" section, "Technology" tab)
For the difference between Preferences and Project Settings, see
<A HREF="chap06-03.html#chap06-03">Section 6-3</A>.
<P>
The Project Settings dialog has controls for MOSIS CMOS
(see <A HREF="chap07-04-02.html#chap07-04-02">Section 7-4-2</A>).
The Preferences dialog has controls for Schematics
(see <A HREF="chap07-05-01.html#chap07-05-01">Section 7-5-1</A>
and <A HREF="chap03-11-02.html#chap03-11-02">Section 3-11-2</A>),

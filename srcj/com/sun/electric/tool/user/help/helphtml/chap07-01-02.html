<!-- HEADER 7-1-2: Controlling Technologies -->

When Electric begins, the status area shows the current "Technology".
To work with a different technology,
use the <B>Change Current Technology...</B> command of the <B>Technology</B> menu.
This will prompt you with a list of available technologies.
Once a choice is made,
the component menu on the left will be redrawn to show the primitive nodes and arcs in the new technology.
Because each technology has its own transparent colors,
you will also notice a chromatic change in the display.
<P>
Electric automatically switches the current technology to match the cell being edited.
If there are multiple cells being edited from different technologies, this switching can become annoying.
To disable automatic technology switching,
use the <B>Cell Options...</B> command of the <B>Cells</B> menu and uncheck "Switch technology to match current cell".
<P>
To see a list of primitive nodes and arcs in the current technology,
use the <B>Describe Current Technology</B> command of the <B>Technology</B> menu.
To get a detailed list of layer, node, and arc information in a technology,
use the <B>Document Technology</B> command.

Some technologies have settable options that further customize them.
The <B>Technology Options...</B> command of the <B>Technology</B> menu provides a dialog for controlling those options.
More information about this dialog is available from the individual technology sections on MOSIS CMOS

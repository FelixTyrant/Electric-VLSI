<!-- HEADER 10-2-3: Technologies -->

<h3>Technologies</h3>
<P>
All technologies used in the library must be in the header.
The other reason for a technology declaration to exist is if the technology has preferences stored on it.
If there are multiple technology lines, they are sorted by technology name.
The syntax is:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><B>T&lt;name&gt; [ | &lt;variable&gt; ]*</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;name&gt;</TD><TD>the name of the technology.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;variable&gt;</TD><TD>a list of preferences on the technology
(stored as variables, see <A HREF="chap10-04-01.html#chap10-04-01">Section 10-4-1</A>).</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Examples:
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>Tmocmos</CODE>
<P>
Declares that there should be a technology called "mocmos".
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>Tmocmos|ScaleFORmocmos()D200</CODE>
<P>
Declares the technology "mocmos" and also creates a preference on that technology object called
"ScaleFORmocmos" which is a double-precision value equal to 200.
<P>
<h3>Primitive Nodes, Arcs, and Ports</h3>
<P>
After a technology declaration, declarations must be made for all nodes, arcs,
and ports in that technology used in the library.
If there are multiple node lines, they are sorted by the node name;
if there are multiple arc lines, they are sorted by the arc name;
if there are multiple port lines in a node, they are sorted by the port name.
The syntax is:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><B>D&lt;node&gt;</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><B>P&lt;port&gt;</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><B>W&lt;arc&gt;</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;node&gt;</TD><TD>the name of a node in the previously-specified technology.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;port&gt;</TD><TD>the name of a port on the previously-specified node.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;arc&gt;</TD><TD>the name of an arc in the previously-specified technology.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

Example:
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>Tschematic</CODE><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>Ncapacitor</CODE><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>Awire</CODE>

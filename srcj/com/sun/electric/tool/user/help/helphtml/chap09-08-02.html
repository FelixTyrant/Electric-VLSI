There are other generators built into Electric.
These commands (in menu <B>Tools / Generation</B>) may be used:
<UL>

<LI><B>Coverage Implants Generator</B>
Although individual MOS nodes and arcs have the proper amount of implant around them,
a collection of such objects may result in an irregular implant boundary.
To clean this up, you can place pure-layer nodes of implant that neatly cover the implant area
(see <A HREF="chap07-01-01.html#chap07-01-01">Section 7-1-1</A>).
This command does it automatically.
It removes previous pieces of coverage implant before running, so that the result is a clean cover.
</LI>

<LI><B>ROM Generator...</B>
The ROM generator constructs many cells to describe a ROM from a personality file.
You will be prompted for the personality file.
The first line of the ROM personality file lists the degree of folding.
For example, a 256-word x 10-bit ROM with a folding degree of 4 will be implemented as a 64 x 40 array
with 4:1 column multiplexors to return 10 bits of data while occupying more of a square form factor.
The number of words and degree of folding should be a power of 2.
The remaining lines of the file list the contents of each word.
The parser is pretty picky.
There should be a carriage return after the list word, but no other blank lines in the file.
Here is a sample ROM file:
<BR>
<CODE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;010101<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;011001<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100101<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101010<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;00000000<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10000000<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;01000000<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11000000
</CODE>
</LI>

<LI><B>MOSIS CMOS PLA Generator...</B>
The MOSIS CMOS PLA generator reads two personality files (AND and OR) and
generates a PLA array.
Each file has only two numbers on the first line to define the size of the array,
and the values of the array on subsequent lines.
Both the AND file and the OR file are similar.
Here is some sample PLA logic:
<CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD>
<I>f</I> = (<I>a</I> <B>and</B> <I>b</I> <B>and</B> (<B>not</B> <I>c</I>)) <B>or</B> ((<B>not</B> <I>b</I>) <B>and</B> (<B>not</B> <I>a</I>))
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>g</I> = (<I>a</I> <B>and</B> <I>c</I>) <B>or</B> ((<B>not</B> <I>a</I>) <B>and</B> (<B>not</B> <I>c</I>))
</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>
Here is the AND file for the above logic:
<BR>
<CODE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;3<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;0<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;X<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;X&nbsp;&nbsp;1<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;X&nbsp;&nbsp;0
</CODE>
</LI>

<LI><B>Fill (MoCMOS)...</B>
Fill cells are used to meet metal density rules in modern fabrication processes
by filling spaces with certain metal layers.
Fill cells are also created to improve chip power distribution and to avoid
voltage drops by inserting cap transistors.
Electric has a coverage facility to evaluate the amount of fill
(see <A HREF="chap09-02-04.html#chap09-02-04">Section 9-2-4</A>).
This command generates fill cells.
<P>
Unlike other fill generators, Electric's fill generator creates cells
containing power and ground grids of specified layers, usually starting at Metal-2.
These cells can also be arrayed into tile cells to cover larger areas.
When Metal-1 is filled, the generator will cover the area with cap transistors whose
functionality is to prevent voltage drops in the power grid.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-59.png" ALT="Figure 9.59" BORDER=0></CENTER>
<P>
The Fill dialog has two tabs: "Floorplan" and "Tiling".
The Floorplan section specifies what is inside of a single fill cell.
The Tiling section specifies how those cells are arrayed.
<P>
The Floorplan section offers two fill techniques: <I>Template Fill</I> and
<I>Fill Cell</I> (not yet available).
Template Fill generates fill cells of a given width and height.
The default values reflect the minimum spacing rules given by the technology.
The "Reserved Space" section lets you specify which layers of metal will be in the fill cells.
These metal layers alternate running horizontally and vertically (the "Even layer orientation"
controls which layer runs horizontally first).
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
The fill cell will have four metal wires running in each direction:
the outer two are Ground and the inner two are Power.
The spacing between the inner two is given in the "Vdd Space" section next
to the selected metal layer.
The spacing between the ground wires and the edge is half of the "Gnd Space"
value.
The spacing between the power and ground wires is the minimal design-rule
spacing for that layer of metal.
The width of the wires is then adjusted to fill the remaining space in the cell.
</TD><TD><IMG SRC="fig09-62.png" ALT="Figure 9.62" BORDER=0></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="fig09-61.png" ALT="Figure 9.61" BORDER=0></TD><TD>
The Tiling section lets you request arrays of fill cells to be generated.
Check the desired sizes and they will be generated.
Each generated array cell will contain the specified-size array,
and it will be internally wired.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
</LI>

<li><B>Stitch-Based Fill Generator</B>
This fill also creates cells or tiles to meet metal density conditions but it is a more generic tool for
signal distribution. It allows to generate fill cells that not only drive the power and ground signals.
The fill takes a set of metal arcs stored in cell and stitches them together based on the network names.
The metal arcs can all be located in the same cell or distributed in different cells.
If the arcs in different cells, the tool will flat the geometry and create one cell with all the signals.
Network names are matched using the string provided until the first "_" is detected.
E.g. Arcs in the networks Vdd_1 and Vdd_2 will be stitched together.
The tool also allows to stitch cell instances without flatting them before doing it. This is typical used
in the case of having cap cells. The tool will use the cell exports for the stitching process.

<p>
There are two ways to run the tool: (1) by using a doc cell containing the fill instructions
(command "Stitch-Based Fill Generator from doc input") and (2) by opening
all the relevant cells in different windows (command "Stitch-Based Fill Generator from open windows").

<p>
By using a doc cell, many fill cells can be generated at once and it is highly recommended in case of
redoing the fill multiple times. Each line in the doc cell follows the syntax below:

<CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD>
<i> fillCellName (&lt options &gt) : cell1(&lt option &gt) cell2(&lt option &gt) ... cellN(&lt option &gt) </i>
</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>

<p>
Where:
<br>"<i>options</i>" can be "W" and/or a sequence of title sizes (e.g. 2x2, 4x4, 3x4).
The option "W" allows the insertion of exports in the middle of the lowest metal arcs and
different tile sizes can be arrayed depeding on the area to cover.
<br>
If "<i>option</i>" is "I" then the cell will be instatiated instead of flatted in the fill cell. By default, all
cells are flatted.
</li>

<LI><B>Generate gate layouts (MoCMOS)</B>
Generates the layout for schematic cells in the Purple and Red libraries
(see <A HREF="chap09-09.html#chap09-09">Section 9-9</A>).
To use this command you must have a schematic in the current window.
The command then hierarchically scans the schematic looking for instances of the
Purple and Red library cells.
When it finds such instances it generates layout for them and places the layout
in a library called "autoGenLibMOCMOS".
If the cell already exists, it is not regenerated.
<P>
The gate layout generator recognizes these gates from the Purple and Red libraries:

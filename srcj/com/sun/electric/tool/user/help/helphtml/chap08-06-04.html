<!-- HEADER 8-6-4: NCC Annotations -->


For certain situations NCC cannot figure out that two cells are
equivalent unless the designer supplies extra information. The
designer supplies this extra information by adding NCC annotations to
layout and/or schematic cells. NCC annotation's are represented by
attributes placed on cells
(see <A HREF="chap06-08-05.html#chap06-08-05">Section 6-8-5</A>).
The attribute's name is
<i>NCC</i>. The attribute's value is one or more lines. Each line
contains a separate NCC annotation. Thus, although a Cell can have at
most one attribute named <i>NCC</i>, that attribute can contain any
number of NCC annotations.

<h3>exportsConnectedByParent <i>&lt;string or regular expression&gt;</i> </h3>

Layout cells sometimes contain multiple exports that are supposed to
be connected by the parent cell. For example, a layout cell, A{lay},
might export vdd, vdd_1, vdd_2, and vdd3. The designer expects the
cell that instantiates A{lay} will connect all the vdd exports to a
single net: vdd. However, because the corresponding schematic cell
usually only contains a single export, vdd, the NCC of the schematic
and layout cells fails. This situation is most common for the power
and ground networks, although it occasionally arises for signal
networks such as <i>clock</i> or <i>precharge</i>.
</p>
<p>
NCC allows the designer to add the annotation:
exportsConnectedByParent to the cell to inform NCC which exports will
be connected by the parent. The keyword is followed by a list of
strings and/or regular expressions. A string matches an export name
exactly, for example: vdd. Thus A{lay} can contain the NCC annotation:
</p>
<p style=padding-left:10px>
exportsConnectedByParent vdd vdd_1 vdd_2
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, the designer can use regular expressions. Regular
expressions begin and end with the character: '/'. Thus A{lay} can
contain the NCC annotation:
</p>
<p style=padding-left:10px>
exportsConnectedByParent vdd /vdd_[0-9]+/
</p>
<p>
When NCC compares a cell with an <i> exportsConnectedByParent </i>
annotation it performs the comparison as if those exports were
connected. It is safe for NCC to believe this annotation because NCC
also checks the assertion. When NCC encounters an instance of a cell
with an <i> exportsConnectedByParent </i> annotation NCC reports an
error whenever that assertion isn't satisfied.
</p>

<h3>skipNCC <i>&lt;comment&gt;</i> </h3>

<P>
The skipNCC annotation should be added to a cell, say B, when:
<ul>
<li>
B{sch} and B{lay} won't pass either flat or hierarchical NCC and
</li>
<li>
you want any hierarchical NCC of the parents of B to flatten the one
level of hierarchy: cell B.
</li>
</ul>
If cell B has a skipNCC annotation, then a hierarchical comparison
won't check B and will simply flatten through the one level of
hierarchy: B.  
<p>
All the characters following the keyword to the end of the
line serve as a comment. This is useful for documenting why this
annotation was necessary. When you ask NCC to compare every cell in
the design, NCC will tell you which cells it is skipping and why.  For
example, if cell B includes the NCC annotation: 
</p>
<p style=padding-left:10px>
skipNCC layout is missing ground connection
</p>
<p>
then NCC will print:
<p style=padding-left:10px>
 Skipping NCC of A because layout is missing ground connection. 
</p>
<p>
A common reason for needing this annotation is an unfortunate
situation: the
exports of B{sch} and B{lay} don't match. A skipNCC on B prevents NCC
from reporting export mismatches because 1) cell B is not checked by
itself and 2) when a parent of cell B is checked, B's exports are
discarded when NCC flattens through cell B. Although not always
possible, it's better to fix export mismatches, because fixing them
will yield clearer mismatch diagnostics when there is a problem.
</p>

<h3>flattenInstances <i>&lt;string or regular expression&gt;</i> ... </h3>
<P>
Hierarchical NCCs do not require a perfect match between the schematic
and layout hierarchies. Instead, hierarchical NCC uses heuristics to
determine which cell instances must be flattened and which can be
compared hierarchically. The heuristic sometimes make mistakes. When
that happens, the flattenInstances annotation can guide the heuristic.
</p>
<p>
The list of strings and/or regular expressions are used to match
instance names within the cell. Those cell instances that match are
always flattened.  
</p>
<BR>

<h3>notSubcircuit <i>&lt;comment&gt;</i>  </h3>

<P>
The designer should add the notSubcircuit annotation to a cell, say B,
if:
<ul>
<li>
B{sch} and B{lay} will pass NCC when compared separately but
</li>
<li>
hierarchical NCC of a parent of B should not treat B as a hierarchical
element but should, instead, flatten through B.
</li>
</ul>
One reason for using this annotation is to correct errors made by the
heuristic that determines which cells to flatten and which to compare
hierarchically.  For example, suppose that the schematics instantiate
cell B{sch} 1000 times and the layout instantiates cell B{lay} 500
times.  In principle one could use the <i>flattenInstances</i>
annotation to inform NCC which instances to keep and which to
flatten. However sometimes that's more work than it's worth and it's
better to add a single <i>notSubcircuit</i> annotation to cell B{sch}
or B{lay} to tell NCC to never treat B as a hierarchical entity.
<p>
When hierarchical NCC encounters a notSubcircuit annotation it prints
a message that includes the comment in a manner similar to skipNCC.
</p>
<p>
The notSubcircuit annotation only affects hierarchical NCCs, it is
ignored by flat NCCs. 
</p>
<BR>

<h3>joinGroup <i>&lt;cell name&gt;</i> </h3> 
<p>
The designer should add a joinGroup annotation to, say, cell B if NCC
should behave as if cell B belonged to a different cell group and that
cell group is in a different library. The cell group to move B to is
that cell group that contains <i>&lt;cell name&gt;</i>. That
specification should be fully qualified: library:cell{view}.
<p>
Memberships in cell groups is important when NCC performs
hierarchical comparisons because NCC assumes that cells in the same
cell group are supposed to be topologically identical. Membership of
two cells in the same cell group is one criteria NCC uses to decide
that it should treat them as hierarchical entities and it should
compare them separately.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally it is impractical to place the layout and schematic views
of a cell in the same cell group.  For example when layout is
automatically generated from hand drawn schematics it may be better to
place the layout in a different library than the schematics.

Electric has the ability to view an integrated circuit in 3-dimensions,
allowing a fuller understanding of the interaction between layers.
When displaying 3D, you can rotate, zoom, pan, and <I>twist</I> the image to get a better view.
However, in 3D mode, you can no longer change the circuit.
<P>
Be aware that 3D viewing is not part of the standard Electric distribution.
Instead, it is a free plugin that must be downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://www.staticfreesoft.com">Static Free Software</A> web site.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>
To see a circuit in 3D, use the <B>3D Display</B> command of the <B>Window</B> menu.
The circuit is displayed in 3D, and mouse movements will rotate, pan, zoom or twist (not yet implemented) the circuit.
Use the left button to rotate and the right button for panning. To zoom in drag the left button by pressing 
<ALT>key in one direction and the opposite to zoom out. 
<P>
For optimal 3D viewing, the circuit should be centered in the window before issuing the
<I><B>3D Display</B></I> command.
Also, the window should not be partitioned (split).
<!--
<P>
Beside rotation, you can pan, zoom, and twist the 3D display.
To switch to these options, use the <B>Pan View Point</B>, <B>Zoom View Point</B>, and <B>Twist View Point</B> subcommands
(and use <B>Rotate View Point</B> to rotate).
These four display modes can also be invoked by simply typing the letters "p", "z", "t", and "r".

To return to a 2-dimensional view, use the <B>View in 2 Dimensions</B> subcommand (not implemented yet!).
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>

To control the 3D view, select the <B>3D</B> preference in the <B>Display</B> option of the <B>Preferences</B> dialog.
<P>
On the left side of this dialog is a list of layers in the current technology.
On the right side is a cross section view of the chip, showing which layers are above which others.
You can select a layer by clicking on either side of the dialog.
The currently selected layer is highlighted in the list on the left and starred in the right-hand view.
<P>
Once selected, you can drag layers to the desired height (on the right side) or type a height value (on the left side).
You can also set the thickness of a layer by typing a value into the field
(typically, only contacts have thickness because they span between layers).
Finally, you can choose whether or not to display with perspective.
<!--The "Clean Up" button and flat-layer separation items are not implemented at this time.-->

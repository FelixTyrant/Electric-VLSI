Electric has the ability to view an integrated circuit in 3-dimensions,
allowing a fuller understanding of the interaction between layers.
When displaying 3D, you can rotate, zoom, and pan the image to get a better view.
However, in 3D mode, you can no longer change the circuit.
<P>
Note that the 3D Display is based on Java3D API therefore it might not work properly if 
MDI mode is switched on and it is not part of the standard Electric distribution.
Instead, it is a free plugin that must be downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://www.staticfreesoft.com">Static Free Software</A> web site.
See <A HREF="chap01-05.html#chap01-05">Section 1-5</A> for details about Electric plugins.

<P>
To see a circuit in 3D, use the <B>3D Display</B> command (in menu <B>Window</B>).
The circuit is displayed in 3D, and mouse movements will rotate, pan, or zoom the circuit.
Use the left button to rotate, the right button for panning and the middle one for zooming.
To zoom in drag the middle button in one direction and the opposite to zoom out.
<P>
Nodes and arcs will be highlighted in the 3D view by clicking in the corresponding 2D instance, and vice versa.
Furthermore, the network tool will also highlight nodes if they are displayed in a 3D view.
In case of cells, bounding boxes will be shown in the scene graph and the interior will be displayed if cells are marked
as extended.
<P>
To control the 3D view,
use the "3D" preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Display" section, "3D" tab).
On the 3D tab, thickness and Z distance of each layer can be modified as well as the view mode,
the scale along Z axis and antialiasing feature.
<P>
Two view modes are available: perspective (default) and parallel views. Unselect radio box "Use Perspective" 
to switch to parallel mode.
If available, antialiasing can be turned on by clicking on radio box "Use Antialiasing".
Due to performance issues, antialiasing is not on by default.
In case of having layers are too thin along Z axis compared to X,Y values, use the scale factor field.
By default it is set to 1.
<!--For optimal 3D viewing, the circuit should be centered in the window before issuing the
<B>3D Display</B> command. -->
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
On the left side of this dialog is a list of layers in the current technology.
On the right side is a cross section view of the chip, showing which layers are above which others.
You can select a layer by clicking on either side of the dialog.
The currently selected layer is highlighted in the list on the left and starred in the right-hand view.
<P>
Once selected, you can drag layers to the desired height (on the right side) or type a height value (on the left side).
You can also set the thickness of a layer by typing a value into the field
(typically, only contacts have thickness because they span between layers).

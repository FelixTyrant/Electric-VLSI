<!-- HEADER 1-11-1: Schematics Example: Make a Cell -->

This section takes you through the design of some simple schematics.
<P>
Electric starts in IC design mode (MOSIS CMOS layout),
so you have to switch to schematics before doing any design.
Use the <B>Change Current Technology...</B> command from the <B>Technology</B> menu.
Select the "schematic, digital" entry (you will have to scroll down to find it) and click OK.
The symbols in the component menu on the left will change to a Digital schematics set.
Analog components can be created by selecting the "schematic, analog" technology,
but they may also be selected with the <B>New Analog Part</B> command in the <B>Edit</B> menu.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Before you can place any schematics, the editing window must have a cell in it.
Use the <B>Edit Cell...</B> command in the <B>Cells</B> menu.
This will show a dialog with a list of existing cells (which is empty, because none exist yet).
Click on the "New Cell" button at the bottom of this dialog to create a new cell.
You will then see a dialog which asks you for information about this new cell.

Type the name ("MyCircuit" is used here) and click OK.
The editing window will no longer have the "No cell in this window" message,
and circuitry may now be created.

<!-- HEADER 9-7-5-2: NCC GUI: Exports -->
<P  STYLE="margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">The
Exports node is always a leaf node with the name &quot;<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Exports
[X]</FONT>&quot;, where <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">X</FONT> is
the number of Export mismatches in this comparison (Figure 1).
Selecting an Exports node displays a table on the right side of the
NCC graphical window (Figure 2). The table has two columns &ndash;
one per compared Cell. The header contains Cell names. Each row
corresponds to a mismatch. A table cell has zero or more <I>Export
lists</I>. An Export list is a list of all the Exports found on a
Network and is displayed as a list of Export names surrounded by
curly brackets <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">{ }</FONT>. Each Export
list is a single hyperlink which highlights  all the Exports in the
list. 
</P>
<P  STYLE="margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">Multiple
Export lists in a table cell occur when a single Network in one
design (e.g. The schematic) has one or more Exports that match
multiple Exports attached to more than one Network in the other
design (e.g. the layout). For example, the mismatch on the third row
from the top in Figure 2 has layout Exports (the second column)
attached to a single Network  matching  schematic Exports (the first
column) attached to two Networks.

<P  STYLE="margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0in">An
empty table cell means one design has Exports that match no Exports
with the same names in the other design. For example, the mismatch in
the top row in Figure 2 has the layout Export <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">E_core_sclk</FONT>
matching no Exports in the schematic.</P>
<P  STYLE="margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">Some
Exports are <I>implied</I>. For example, if a schematic Cell uses a
global ground, but does not contain an Export for that ground, then
NCC will automatically insert an <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">implied</SPAN><I>
</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Export for ground</SPAN>. This
is done because most often the corresponding layout Cell has a ground
Export, and we want the schematic and layout Cells to match. Implied
Exports are not hyperlinked and have &quot; <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">:
implied</FONT>&quot; added to their names (Figure 3). 
</P>
<P  STYLE="margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">When
NCC does not find any topological mismatches, it attempts to suggest
possible matches for Exports that failed to match by name. Such
<I>suggestions</I> are printed in green. The first row of the table
in Figure 3 indicates that the <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">outO[1][T]</FONT>
Export in the layout topologically matches the <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">outO[T]</FONT>
Export in the schematic, even though they have different names. The
second row indicates that the <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">outE[1][F]</FONT>
Export in the layout topologically matches the <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">net@4[1]</FONT>
Wire in the schematic, even though the <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">net@4[1]</FONT>
Wire has no Exports. Note that a Wire name is not an Export list and
is not surrounded by curly brackets.</P>

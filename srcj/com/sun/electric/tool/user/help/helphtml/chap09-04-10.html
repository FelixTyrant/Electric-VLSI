<!-- COMMAND Tool/Simulation (Built-In)/ALS: Simulate Current Cell -->

Electric has a built-in gate-level simulator called ALS that can simulate schematics,
IC layout, or VHDL descriptions.
<P>
To begin simulation of the circuit in the current window,
use the <B>ALS: Simulate This Cell</B> command (from <B>Tools / Simulation (Built-in)</B>).
The simulator already knows about MOS transistors.
The ALS simulator also knows about many digital logic gates and can be programmed to describe
any function with the hardware description language described later in this chapter.
For an example of simulation, open the library file "samples.txt" and edit the cell "tool-SimulateALS"
(you can read the library with the <B>Readable Dump</B> subcommand of the <B>Import</B>
command of the <B>File</B> menu).

<!-- COMMAND Edit/Selection/Pop Selection -->

Once a selection is made, you can save it with the <B>Push Selection</B> command
(in menu <B>Edit / Selection</B>).
The highlighting is not changed, but it is saved on a stack.
To restore this selection at a later time, use the <B>Pop Selection</B> subcommand.

There are some selection preferences that can be set with "Selection" preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "General" section, "Selection" tab).
"Easy selection" controls whether objects can be selected with simple clicks, or whether they require extra effort to select.
You can request that all cell instances be hard to select and that all annotation text be hard to select.
See the (<A HREF="chap02-01-05.html#chap02-01-05">next section</A>) for more on this.
<P>
The "Dragging must enclose entire object" requests that area-selection completely enclose an object in order to select it.
The default is that any object touching the area is selected.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
To prevent accidental moving of an object after selecting it,
object movement is disabled for a short time after the selection click.
This delay can be controlled.

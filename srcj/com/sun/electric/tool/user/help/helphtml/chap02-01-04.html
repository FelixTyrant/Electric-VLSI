<!-- HEADER 2-1-4: Controlling Selection -->

Once a selection is made, you can save it with the <B>Push Selection</B> subcommand of the
<B>Selection</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
The highlighting is not changed, but it is saved on a stack.
To restore this selection at a later time, use the <B>Pop Selection</B> subcommand.
<P>
The <B>Deselect All Arcs</B> command deselects all selected arcs.
This is useful when you wish to select a set of nodes,
but you have selected the entire area, including nodes and arcs.
The <B>Select Nothing</B> command deselects everything.

To control special selection features,
use the <B>Selection Options...</B> subcommand of the <B>Selection</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
The "Center-based primitives" option controls how primitive nodes are created
(see <A HREF="chap02-02.html#chap02-02">Section 2-2</A>).
The "Dragging must enclose entire object" requests that area-selection completely enclose an object in order to select it.
The default is that any object touching the area is selected.

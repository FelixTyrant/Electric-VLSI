<!-- HEADER 1-9: The Keyboard -->

<TABLE><TR><TD>
Many common commands can be invoked by typing "quick keys" for them.
These quick keys are shown in the pulldown menus next to the item.
For example, the <B>New Cell...</B> command (in menu <B>Cell</B>) has the quick key "Control-N".
On the Macintosh, the menu shows "<IMG SRC="iconcommand.png" ALT="CMD-">N",
indicating that you must hold the command key while typing the "N";
on Windows and UNIX systems, the menu shows "Ctrl-N",
indicating that you must hold the Control key while typing "N".
There are also unshifted quick keys (for example,
typing the letter "n" brings up a <B>Place Cell Instance</B> command).

<P>
To change the bindings of quick keys,
use the "Key Bindings" preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Key Bindings" tab).
The dialog shows the hierarchical structure of the pulldown menus on the top,
and lets you add or remove key bindings in the bottom area.
<P>
You can remove a quick key binding with the "Remove" button,
and you can add a quick key binding with the "Add" button.
The "Reset" button restores default quick key bindings.
Change key bindings with caution, because it customizes your user interface,
making it more difficult for other users to work at your station.

<H2>The Abort Key</H2>
<P>
Some operations can be aborted by typing the Escape key.
For example, if you are moving or wiring, and have pressed the mouse button but not released it yet,
you will see that the expected operation is shown on the screen.
To abort this operation, type Escape.

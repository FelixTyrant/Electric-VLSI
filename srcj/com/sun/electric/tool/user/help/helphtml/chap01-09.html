<!-- HEADER 1-9: The Keyboard -->

<H3>Quick Keys</H3>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Many common commands can be invoked by typing "quick keys" for them.
These quick keys are shown in the pulldown menus next to the item.
For example, the <B>Negated</B> command of the <B>Arc</B> menu has the quick key "Control-T".
On the Macintosh, the menu shows "<IMG SRC="iconcommand.png" ALT="CMD-">T",
indicating that you must hold the command key while typing the "T";
on Windows and UNIX systems, the menu shows "Ctrl-T",
indicating that you must hold the Control key while typing "T".
There are also unshifted quick keys (for example,
typing the letter "A" repeats the last command by invoking the
<B>Repeat Last Command</B> subcommand of the <B>User Interface</B> command of the <B>Info</B> menu).
<P>
To change the bindings of quick keys,
use the <B>Quick Key Options...</B> subcommand of the <B>User Interface</B> command of the <B>Info</B> menu.
The dialog shows the hierarchical structure of the pulldown menus on the left,
and a list of quick keys on the right.

<P>
You can remove a quick key binding with the "Remove" button,
and you can add a quick key binding with the ">>" button.
The "Factory Settings" button restores default quick key bindings.
Use the <B>Quick Key Options...</B> command with caution, because it customizes your user interface,
making it more difficult for other users to work at your station.
<P>
Note that the Function keys of most keyboards (F1 through F12) can also be attached to menu items.
Be warned that many window systems take control of the higher function keys,
and so attaching Electric commands to them may not work.
<P>
On Windows and UNIX systems, you can get to EVERY menu command with key sequences.
The keys to use are underlined in the menus.
For example, the <B>File</B> menu has the "F" underlined,
and the <B>Print...</B> command of that menu has the "P" underlined.
This means that you can hold the Alt key and type "FP" to issue the print command.
<P>
<H3>The Interrupt Key</H3>
<P>
Many operations take a long time in Electric.
If you grow impatient, type the interrupt key.
This key varies with the different platforms:
<UL>
<LI>On UNIX, type Ctrl-C (hold the Control key and type "c").
<LI>On Windows, type <IMG SRC="iconwindows.png" ALT="CMD">C
(hold the Windows key and type "c").
<LI>On a Macintosh, type <IMG SRC="iconcommand.png" ALT="CMD">.
(hold the Command key and type ".").
</UL>
Note that on UNIX systems, you have to type Ctrl-C in the messages window,
because typing it in the edit windows invokes a menu item.
<P>
Also, if you have pressed the mouse button but not released it yet,
you will note that many operations track the effects of your intended operation on the screen.
To abort this operation, type the interrupt key or the letter "a".

<!-- HEADER 9-7-5-5: NCC GUI: Export Assertions -->
<P  STYLE="margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.08in; font-weight: medium">
<FONT FACE="Thorndale, serif">It is very common for a layout Cell, <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">A</FONT>,
to have multiple ground Wires that are connected by <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">A</FONT>'s
parent Cell, <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">B</FONT>. For example,
Cell <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">A</FONT> may have a Wire with the
Export <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">gnd</FONT> and a different Wire
with the Export <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">gnd_1</FONT>. When
Cell <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">B</FONT> instantiates <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">A</FONT>,
Cell <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">B</FONT> connects <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">A</FONT>'s
Exports <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">gnd</FONT> and <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">gnd_1</FONT>.
However, <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">A</FONT>'s schematic
typically has only one combined <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">gnd</FONT>
Wire. When NCC compares <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">A</FONT>'s
schematic and layout, it finds that the ground Wires mismatch. As a
solution, the designer adds the following NCC annotation into <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">A</FONT>'s
layout cell:</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.08in; font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">exportsConnectedByParent gnd gnd_1</FONT></P>
<P  STYLE="margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.08in; font-weight: medium">
<FONT FACE="Thorndale, serif">This annotation constitutes a promise
that whenever <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">A</FONT> is
instantiated, its Exports <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">gnd</FONT>
and <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">gnd_1</FONT> will be connected.
Then, when NCC compares A's schematic and layout, it assumes that the
promise has been kept and the comparison passes. However, when NCC
compares <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">B</FONT>'s schematic and
layout, it checks to see if the designer is keeping the promise. If
the promise is not kept, and no new promise to connect Exports in the
next parent is given, then NCC reports an Export assertion error in
the &quot;<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Export Assertions</FONT>&quot;
leaf node.</FONT></P>
<P  STYLE="margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.08in; font-weight: medium">
<FONT FACE="Thorndale, serif">When an &quot;<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Export
Assertions</FONT>&quot; node is selected, it displays a table with
two columns and one or more rows (Figure 11). Each row corresponds to
a broken promise. The first column has Cell names. The second column
lists Exports that the designer promised would be connected, but
which remained disconnected. The Exports are organized into two or
more Export lists. Each Export list is a comma-separated list of
Exports enclosed in curly brackets <FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">{
}</FONT>. Exports in the same list are connected. Exports in
different lists are disconnected. The designer promised that all
Exports in all lists would be connected. All exports are individually
highlightable. </FONT>

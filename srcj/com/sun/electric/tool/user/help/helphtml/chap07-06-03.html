<!-- HEADER 7-6-3: The Generic Technology -->

One particularly interesting technology is the Generic technology,
which is a grab bag of miscellaneous facilities.
It is not necessary to actually switch into this technology,
for all of its nodes and arcs are available through other means.
<P>
<H3>Special Arcs</H3>
<P>
The <I>Universal arc</I> in the Generic technology is able to make a connection between any two components,
even if they are in different technologies.
This is useful when mixing technologies while still maintaining proper connectivity,
for example when simulating.
The <I>Invisible arc</I> attaches any two components, but makes no electrical connection.
It is useful for constraining otherwise unrelated components.
The <I>Unrouted arc</I> makes arbitrary electrical connections,
like the universal arc, but routers know to replace them with real geometry.
None of these arcs produce any actual geometry in IC descriptions,
but they make important conceptual connections.
<P>
Any existing arc in a normal technology can be converted to one of these three special arcs by using the <B>Change...</B>
command (in menu <B>Edit</B>).
<P>
<H3>Special Nodes</H3>
<P>
There are also special nodes in the Generic technology.
They are all available from the "Misc." entry of the component menu.
<P>
The <I>Universal-Pin</I> is a node that can connect to any arc.
This is useful as an intermediate component when replacing
(first you replace the unwanted node with a Universal-Pin to allow it to fit with the existing arcs;
then you replace the arcs; finally you put the desired new node in place).
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
The <I>Invisible-Pin</I> is used for holding text,
and it does not appear in hardcopy output
(this is what is created when you use place Annotation Text).
This pin can also connect to any arc.
<P>
A special primitive, called <I>Cell-Center</I>, defines the origin of any cell.
Once the node is placed, its location is at (0,0) for the cell.
Since instances of the current cell use the origin as the <I>anchor point</I> for cursor-based references,
the location of this node defines the anchor.
For example, if you place this node in the upper-right corner of a cell,
then creation commands place instances such that their upper-right corner is at the cursor.
See <A HREF="chap03-03.html#chap03-03">Section 3-3</A> for more information on cell centers.

<P>
A special primitive, called <I>Essential-Bounds</I>, defines an alternate boundary of any cell.
At least two of them must be placed in opposite corners, although 4 can be place to make it look better.
<P>
Note that the Cell-Center and Essential-Bounds nodes are made "hard-to-select" by default,
which means that they can be selected only by using "Special Select" mode
(see <A HREF="chap02-01-05.html#chap02-01-05">Section 2-1-5</A> for more).
<P>
A special primitive, called <I>Simulation-Probe</I> is recognized by simulators and visually modified to reflect
whatever it is connected to.
The simulators that reflect the state of the circuit by drawing lines along arcs also fill-in these probe nodes.
It provides a visual display of simulation activity, and works especially well with the
VCR controls in the waveform window.
See <A HREF="chap04-12-01.html#chap04-12-01">Section 4-12-1</A> for more.

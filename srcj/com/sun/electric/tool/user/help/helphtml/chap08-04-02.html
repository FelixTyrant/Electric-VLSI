<!-- HEADER 8-4-2: Verilog -->

Besides generating Verilog decks,
it is possible to annotate circuits with additional Verilog declarations and code that will be included in the deck.
The subcommands <B>Add Verilog Code</B> and <B>Add Verilog Declaration</B> of the <B>Simulation (Verilog)</B>
command of the <B>Tools</B> menu allow you to click in the circuit and type code or declarations.
These pieces of text can be manipulated like any other text object
(see <A HREF="chap06-08.html#chap06-08">Section 6-8</A> on text).
<P>
Additional control of Verilog deck generation is accomplished with the <B>Verilog Options...</B> subcommand.
A checkbox lets you choose whether or not to use the Verilog "assign" construct.
You can control the type of Verilog declaration that will be used for wires ("wire" by default, "trireg" if checked).
Note that this can be overridden with the <B>Set Verilog Wire</B> subcommand of the <B>Simulation (Verilog)</B>
command of the <B>Tools</B> menu.
<P>
The Verilog Options dialog also lets you attach disk files with Verilog code to any cell in the library.
Once attached, the generated Verilog will use the contents of that file instead of examining the cell contents.
This allows you to create your own definitions in situations where the derived Verilog would be too complex or otherwise incorrect.
For an example of Verilog layout and code, look at the cell "tool-SimulateVERILOG" in the library "samples.txt"
(you can read the library with the <B>Readable Dump</B> subcommand of the <B>Import</B> command of the <B>File</B> menu).

<P>
After running a Verilog simulation, you can read the dump file into Electric and display it in a waveform window.
This is done with the <B>Plot Verilog VCD Dump...</B> subcommand of the <B>Simulation (Verilog)</B>
command of the <B>Tools</B> menu (or just <B>Plot Verilog for This Cell</B> if the cell name and file name are the same).
Control of the waveform window is described more fully in
<A HREF="chap10-02.html#chap10-02">Section 10-2</A>.

<!-- HEADER 2-5-1: Node Sizing -->

<!-- COMMAND Edit/Size/Interactively -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Size/All Selected Nodes... -->

To change the size of a node, select it and use the <B>Interactively</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Size</B>).
After you do that, your mouse movements will stretch an outline around the node.
Adjust the mouse to the desired position and click.
To constrain sizing so that only one dimension changes, hold the Control key while moving the mouse.
To abort this operation, type Escape.

To change the size of more than one node at a time,
select the nodes and use the <B>All Selected Nodes...</B> command.
The dialog allows you to set the X and Y sizes of the selected nodes.
If you leave one of these size fields empty, that coordinate is not changed.

<P>
Note that when typing size amounts into a dialog, specify the size of the highlighted area.
In a typical MOS transistor, the highlighted area
(where active and polysilicon cross) is 2x3,
even though the component is much larger if you include the four overlap regions sticking out.

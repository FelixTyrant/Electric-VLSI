<!-- HEADER 2-5-1: Node Sizing -->

To change the size of a node, select it and use the <B>Interactively</B> subcommand of the <B>Size</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
After you do that, your mouse movements will stretch the corner of the node that was closest to it.
The opposite corner will remain fixed.
Adjust the mouse to the desired position and click.
To constrain sizing so that only one dimension changes, hold the Control key while moving the mouse.
To abort this operation, type "a".

To change the size of more than one node at a time,
select the nodes and use the <B>All Selected Nodes</B> subcommand.
The dialog allows you to set the X and Y sizes of the selected nodes.
If you leave one of these size fields empty, that coordinate is not changed.

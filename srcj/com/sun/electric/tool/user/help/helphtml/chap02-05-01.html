<!-- HEADER 2-5-1: Node Sizing -->

<!-- COMMAND Edit/Size/Interactively -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Size/All Selected Nodes... -->

To change the size of a node, select it and use the <B>Interactively</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Size</B>).
After you do that, your mouse movements will stretch an outline around the node.
The outline is anchored at the corner farthest from the cursor, and stretches the corner closest to the cursor.
While stretching the node, hold the Control key to constrain the size to just one axis,
and hold the Shift key to constrain the X and Y sizes so that they scale uniformly.
<P>
An alternate way to resize is to anchor the center of the node and stretch the closest corner to the cursor
(with the other three corners adjusting similarly).
To get this alternate resizing, press the Control and Shift keys while the mouse is pressed.
<P>
If you hold the mouse button down while dragging, you can see the final size of the node.
Release the mouse button to actually resize the node.
To abort this operation, type Escape.
<P>
To constrain sizing so that only one dimension changes, hold the Control key while moving the mouse.

To change the size of more than one node at a time,
select the nodes and use the <B>All Selected Nodes...</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Size</B>).
The dialog allows you to set the X and Y sizes of the selected nodes.
If you leave one of these size fields empty, that coordinate is not changed.

<P>
Note that when typing size amounts into a dialog, specify the size of the highlighted area.
In a typical MOS transistor, the highlighted area
(where active and polysilicon cross) is 2x3,
even though the component is much larger if you include the four overlap regions sticking out.

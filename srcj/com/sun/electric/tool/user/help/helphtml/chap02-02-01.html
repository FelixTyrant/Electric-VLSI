<!-- HEADER 2-2-1: Node Creation -->

Node creation is done by selecting a node from the component menu on the left,
or by using one of the <B>New</B> commands of the <B>Edit</B> menu (<B>New Cell Instance</B>,
<B>New Analog Part</B>, <B>New Spice Part</B>,
<B>New Pure Layer Node</B>, <B>New Special Object</B>).
These commands then wait for a click in the editing window to place the component.
The location of the cursor is aligned to the nearest grid unit,
and this adjustment can be controlled with the <B>Alignment Options...</B> command of the <B>Windows</B> menu.
<P>
When placing a node, the cursor points to the <I>grab point</I> of the newly created node.
By default, this is the center (for primitives) or the lower-left corner (for cell instances).
Primitive nodes can use the lower-left corner as the grab-point by unchecking the
"Center-based primitives" checkbox in the <B>Selection Options...</B> subcommand of the <B>Selection</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
When this is unchecked, the <B>Get Info</B> dialog shows the node's lower-left position,
rather than its center.
<P>
Cell instances can change their grab-point by placing a Cell-Center node inside of their layout
(see <A HREF="chap03-03.html#chap03-03">Section 3-3</A>).

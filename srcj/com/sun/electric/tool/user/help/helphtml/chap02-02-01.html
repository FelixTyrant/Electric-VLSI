<!-- HEADER 2-2-1: Node Creation -->

Node creation is done by selecting a node from the component menu in the side bar (on the left).
The nodes are outlined in blue.
After clicking on one of these nodes, click in the edit window to place the node.
<P>
The location of the cursor is aligned to the nearest grid unit.
This adjustment can be controlled with the
"Grid" preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Display" section, "Grid" tab).
<P>
When placing a node, the cursor points to the <I>anchor point</I> of the newly created node.
This is the center (for primitives) or the location of the cell-center (for cell instances).
Cell instances can change their anchor point by moving the Cell-Center node inside of their layout
(see <A HREF="chap03-03.html#chap03-03">Section 3-3</A>).
<P>
Besides basic components, there are special entries in the component menu for creation of additional nodes:
<UL>
<LI>The "Cell" button displays a list of cell instances that can be created
(see <A HREF="chap03-03.html#chap03-03">Section 3-3</A>).</LI>
<LI>The "Pure" button (only available in layout technologies) lets you place pure-layer nodes
(see <A HREF="chap06-10-01.html#chap06-10-01">Section 6-10-1</A>).</LI>
<LI>The "Spice" button (only available in schematics) lets you place Spice primitives
(see <A HREF="chap09-04-03.html#chap09-04-03">Section 9-4-3</A>).</LI>
<LI>The "Misc" button has a collection of special objects that can be created.</LI>
</UL>
<TABLE><TR><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig02-17.png" ALT="Figure 2.17"></CENTER></TD><TD>
These objects can be created with the "Misc" button:
<UL>
<LI><B>Cell Instance</B> brings up a dialog to select an instance to place
(see <A HREF="chap03-03.html#chap03-03">Section 3-3</A>).</LI>

(see <A HREF="chap06-08-01.html#chap06-08-01">Section 6-8-1</A>).</LI>
<LI><B>Layout Text...</B> brings up a dialog to create text from layout nodes

<LI><B>Annular Ring...</B> brings up a dialog to create circular shapes
(see <A HREF="chap06-10-03.html#chap06-10-03">Section 6-10-3</A>).</LI>
<LI><B>Cell Center</B> places a node that defines the origin of the cell
(see <A HREF="chap03-03.html#chap03-03">Section 3-3</A>).</LI>
<LI><B>Essential Bounds</B> places a node that defines the corners of the cell's essential bounds
(see <A HREF="chap07-06-03.html#chap07-06-03">Section 7-6-3</A>).</LI>
</UL>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<UL>
<LI><B>Spice Code</B> places a text-only node that will be inserted into Spice decks
(see <A HREF="chap09-04-03.html#chap09-04-03">Section 9-4-3</A>).</LI>
<LI><B>Spice Declaration</B> places a text-only node that will be inserted into Spice decks near the top
(see <A HREF="chap09-04-03.html#chap09-04-03">Section 9-4-3</A>).</LI>
<LI><B>Verilog Code</B> places a text-only node that will be inserted into the code area of Verilog decks

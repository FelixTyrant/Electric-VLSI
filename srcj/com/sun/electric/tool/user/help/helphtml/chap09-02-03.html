<!-- HEADER 9-2-3: Coverage Rules -->

<!-- COMMAND Tool/DRC/Check Area Coverage -->
<!-- PREFERENCE Tools/Coverage -->

Some foundries request that each layer occupy a minimum percentage of the chip.
To enforce such rules, additional pieces of geometry must be placed around the chip to fill that layer.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
To check for proper minimum layer coverage, use the <B>Check Area Coverage</B> command
(of menu <B>Tool / DRC</B>).
To control the coverage rules, use the "Coverage" preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Coverage" tab).
Each layer in the technology has a minimum percentage of coverage that is needed.
<P>
The coverage check can proceed in a "tiled" manner, checking rectangular areas of the cell.
For example, to check each 100x100 unit area of the cell, set "Width" and "Height" to 100,
and set "DeltaX" and "DeltaY" to 100.

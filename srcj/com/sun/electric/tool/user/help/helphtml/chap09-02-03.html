<!-- HEADER 9-2-3: Schematic DRC -->

Although the Design Rule checker is primarily for layout, it can also check schematic cells.
When run on Schematics, the checker is looking for issues that make the drawing or editing of the cell difficult.
<P>
Here are the errors found by the schematic DRC:
<OL>
<LI>Nodes:
	<UL>
	<LI>Flag nodes whose parameters don't match the cell definition (check export names, units, and visibility).</LI>
	<LI>Flag "Stranded" pins: with no connections, exports, or attached text.</LI>
	<LI>Flag "Inline" pins: those that sit in a line between two arcs (both of which could be replaced by a single straight arc).</LI>
	<LI>Flag invisible pins with text that is offset from the node center (this is an internal consistency check).</LI>
	</UL></LI>


<LI>Arcs:
	<UL>
	<LI>Flag unnamed arcs that "dangle": one end is unconnected and unexported (does not apply to busses).</LI>
	<LI>Flag Bus arcs whose width is inconsistent with its two nodes.</LI>
	<LI>Flag Bus pins that "float": do not connect to bus arcs and are not exported.</LI>
	<LI>Flag Bus pins that connect to more than 1 wire.</LI>
	</UL></LI>
</OL>

EDIF (Electronic Design Interchange Format) is used to exchange design information between
different CAD systems.
Although EDIF is currently at version "4 0 0", Electric reads and writes version "2 0 0".
For more information on reading and writing EDIF, see
<A HREF="chap03-09-02.html#chap03-09-02">Section 3-9-2</A> and
<A HREF="chap03-09-03.html#chap03-09-03">Section 3-9-3</A>, respectively.
EDIF options are controlled with the "EDIF" preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "I/O" section, "EDIF" tab).

It also lets you set a scale factor for EDIF input.

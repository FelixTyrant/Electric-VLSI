<!-- PREFERENCE I/O/EDIF -->

EDIF (Electronic Design Interchange Format) is used to exchange design information between
different CAD systems.
Although EDIF is currently at version "4 0 0", Electric reads and writes version "2 0 0".
EDIF options are controlled with the "EDIF" preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "I/O" section, "EDIF" tab).

This dialog controls whether EDIF output writes schematic or netlist views (the default is netlist).
It also lets you set a scale factor for EDIF input.

<!-- HEADER 2-1-5: Easy and Hard Selection -->

In a busy circuit, many objects may overlap, causing confusion when selecting.
To simplify selection, objects can be marked so that they are no longer <I>easy-to-select</I>,
which means that standard selection does not work on them.
When objects are not easy-to-select,
they require the use of the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:meta-left  Windows:alt-left  Mac:opt-click">special select</A></I> button in order to find them
(typically the same as the <I>selection</I> button but with the Alt/Meta/Option key held).
Toggling selection of objects that are not easy-to-select requires the use of the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:shift-meta-left  Windows:shift-alt-left  Mac:shift-opt-click">toggle special select</A></I> button.
Cycling through multiple objects that are not easy-to-select requires the use of the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:ctrl-meta-left  Windows:ctrl-alt-left  Mac:ctrl-opt-click">special select another</A></I> button.
Finally, toggling and cycling through objects that are not easy-to-select is done with the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:shift-ctrl-meta-left  Windows:shift-ctrl-alt-left  Mac:shift-ctrl-opt-click">toggle special select another</A></I> button.
<P>
Ease of selection extends to more than just nodes and arcs.
There are four "classes" of objects that can be selected:
<UL>
<LI>Basic objects (all arcs, primitive nodes, and port names)
<LI>Cell instances
<LI>Annotation text (names and other text placed on nodes and arcs)
<LI>Special objects (the text of a cell instance's name)
</UL>
By default, the first three classes are easy-to-select, and special objects are hard-to-select.
If you uncheck "Easy selection of cell instances" in the <B>Selection Options...</B> dialog,
then cell instances become hard-to-select.
If you uncheck "Easy selection of annotation text" in the <B>Selection Options...</B> dialog,
then annotation text becomes hard-to-select.
<P>
Although all nodes and arcs are typically easy-to-select,
you can control them individually by unchecking the "Easy to Select" field in their info dialog
(use the <B>Get Info</B> command of the <B>Info</B> menu).
If multiple objects are selected, the <B>Get Info</B> dialog has a popup in the lower-right for changing their selection difficulty.
Special commands exist in the <B>Selection</B> menu for dealing with easy-to-select nodes and arcs.
You can select all of the easy-to-select objects in the current cell with the <B>Select All Easy</B> command.
Similarly, you can select those that are not easy-to-select with the <B>Select All Hard</B> command.
To change the ease of selection for a set of objects,
select them and use either <B>Make Selected Easy</B> or <B>Make Selected Hard</B>.

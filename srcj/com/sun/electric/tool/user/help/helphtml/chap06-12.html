Electric uses separate Java threads for all activities.
Because of this, if the system encounters an error, it aborts the thread but
the main program continues to run.
<P>
If you suspect that the database is corrupt, use the
 subcommands of the
<B>Check Libraries</B> command (in menu <B>File</B>).
The <B>Check</B> command examines the database but does not fix errors.
The <B>Repair</B> command checks and repairs the database (if it can).
<P>
The networks may also need to be renumbered.
Do this with <B>Redo Network Numbering</B> command (in menu <B>Tool / Network</B>).

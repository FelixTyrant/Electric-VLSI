<!-- HEADER 6-12: Emergencies -->

<!-- COMMAND File/Repair Libraries -->
<!-- COMMAND Tool/Network/Redo Network Numbering -->

Electric uses separate Java threads for all activities.
Because of this, if the system encounters an error, it aborts the thread but
the main program continues to run.
<P>
If you suspect that the database is corrupt, use the
<B>Repair Libraries</B> (in menu <B>File</B>).
<P>
The networks may also need to be renumbered.
Do this with <B>Redo Network Numbering</B> command (in menu <B>Tool / Network</B>).

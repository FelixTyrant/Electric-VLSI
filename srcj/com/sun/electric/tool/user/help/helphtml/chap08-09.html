<!-- HEADER 8-9: Parasitic Extraction -->


<P>
The Parasitic Extraction tool is used by netlisters and other parts of the system that need to know
about geometric factors that affect performance.
To control Parasitic Extraction, use the
"Parasitic" preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Parasitic" tab).
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Currently, the tool does very little, and has no useful controls.
"Maximum distance"
 defines the extent to which the system will search for related wires.

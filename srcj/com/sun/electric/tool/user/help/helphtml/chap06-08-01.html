<!-- HEADER 6-8-1: Understanding Text -->

There are a number of ways to place text in a circuit.
<UL>
<LI>
Each unexpanded instance of a cell has text that describes it, and its ports.
</LI>
<LI>Each export has a text label.
</LI>
<LI>Nodes and arcs can be named (with <B>Object Properties...</B>) so that they have text on them.
They can also have additional attributes that appear as text.
</LI>
<LI>Certain primitive nodes (such as the Flip-Flop component of the Schematic technology)
have text as an integral part of their image.
</LI>
<LI>It is even possible to create a special node that is only text
(with some of the commands under the "Misc" entry of the component menu:
"Annotation Text", "Spice Code", "Spice Declaration", "Verilog Code", and "Verilog Declaration".
</LI>
<LI>Schematic and icon cells can have parameter definitions,
and the instances of those cells can have parameter values.
</UL>
Essentially, then, every piece of text on the display is tied to some node or arc (or occasionally a cell).
By understanding the relationships between text and the attached objects,
it becomes easy to manipulate that text.
<P>
The visibility of text can be controlled with the "Layers" tab of the sidebar
(see <A HREF="chap04-05-03.html#chap04-05-03">Section 4-5-3</A>).
This allows you to reduce the clutter of text on the display.

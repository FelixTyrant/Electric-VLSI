<!-- HEADER 6-8-1: Understanding Text -->

There are a number of ways to place text in a circuit.
<UL>
<LI>
Each unexpanded instance of a cell has text that describes it, and its ports.
<LI>
Each export has a text label.
<LI>
Nodes and arcs can be named (with <B>Get Info</B>) so that they have text on them.
<LI>
Certain primitive nodes (such as the Flip-Flop component of the Schematic technology)
have text as an integral part of their image.
<LI>
It is even possible to create a special node that is only text
(with the <B>Text (nonlayout)</B> subcommand of the <B>New Special Object</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu;
the <B>Add Verilog Code/Declaration</B> subcommands of the <B>Simulation (Verilog)</B> command of the <B>Tools</B> menu;
the <B>Add SPICE Card</B> subcommands of the <B>Simulation (SPICE)</B> command of the <B>Tools</B> menu).
</UL>
Essentially, then, every piece of text on the display is tied to some node or arc.
By understanding the relationships between text and the attached objects,
it becomes easy to manipulate that text.

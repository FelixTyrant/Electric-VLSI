<!-- HEADER 5-1: Introduction to Arcs -->

<TABLE><TR><TD>
The arcs in a circuit are much more than simple connecting wires.
They can take many different forms according to the needs of the design environment.
In schematics, arcs can be negated.
In layout, they can be curved, directional, and more.

<P>
The most important property of an arc is its ability to remain connected when physical changes are made to the circuit.
Constraining properties provide for intelligent circuit layout.

<!-- HEADER 4-7-4: Measuring -->

As an aid to precise alignment, the cursor coordinates can be displayed.
To do this, use the <B>Preferences...</B> command of the <B>File</B>
 menu,
in the "General" tab of the "General" section.
Check the "Show cursor coordinates in status bar"
and the X and Y cursor positions will be continuously displayed in the status area.

If you wish to find the distance between any two points on the display,
use the "Measure" tool from the tool bar.
In measure mode, each click places a new point on the display, and shows the distance to the previous point.
Clicking the right button lets you start a new measure point without connecting it to the previous one.
Double-clicking the right button removes the measurements.

The measured distance can be used by the <B>Array...</B> command to specify spacing
(see <A HREF="chap06-04.html#chap06-04">Section 6-4</A>).

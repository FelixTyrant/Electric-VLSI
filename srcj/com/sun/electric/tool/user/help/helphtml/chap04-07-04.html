<!-- HEADER 4-7-4: Measuring -->

As an aid to precise alignment, the <B>Show Cursor Coordinates</B> command of the <B>Info</B>
menu causes the X and Y cursor positions to be continuously displayed in the status area.
This information appears where the Technology and Lambda used to be.
To restore display of Technology and Lambda values,
uncheck this menu entry.
<P>
If you wish to find the distance between any two points on the display,
use the <B>Measure Distance</B> command of the <B>Info</B> menu.
After this command is issued, click in the circuit to set the "starting point".
Then click repeatedly in the circuit to define the "ending point" and see the measured distance.
To end distance measurement, issue the command again.
The measured distance can be used by the <B>Array...</B> command to specify spacing
(see <A HREF="chap06-04.html#chap06-04">Section 6-4</A>).

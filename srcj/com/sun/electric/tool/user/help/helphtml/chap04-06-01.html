<!-- HEADER 4-6-1: Electric's Color Model -->

The subcommands in the <B>Color Options</B> command of the <B>Windows</B>
menu control the appearance of individual layers in the editing window.
Before explaining these commands,
it is useful to understand the distinction between <I>transparent</I> and <I>opaque</I> layers in Electric.
<P>
On color displays, up to five of the layers can be transparent,
meaning that when they overlap each other, it is possible to see all of them.
Typically, the most commonly used layers are transparent because it is both faster to draw and clearer to distinguish.
The remaining layers in a technology are opaque,
meaning that when drawn,
they completely obscure anything underneath.
These layers typically have stipple patterns so that they do not cover all of the bits.
In this way, the opaque layers can combine without obscuring the display.
Because stipple patterns are slower to draw, and because opaque color does obscure,
the less common layers are drawn in this style.
When editing colors, the opaque layers have only one color,
whereas the transparent layers have up to 16 different colors,
considering their interaction with other transparent layers.

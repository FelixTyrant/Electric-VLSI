There are two commands for controlling settings in Electric: <B>Preferences...</B> and <B>Project Settings...</B>
(both in menu <B>File</B>.  You can also get Preferences with this icon on the tool bar.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

These two dialogs contain many panels for controling different aspects of the system.
The differences between these two dialogs is:
<UL>
<LI><B>Preferences</B> affect the user's interaction with the system.
Examples are printer control, display colors, and keyboard bindings.
Each user may have different preferences, and it does not impact the design being done.</LI>
<LI><B>Project Settings</B> affect the actual circuitry being edited
(and so should be the same for every user who is editing that circuitry).
Examples are GDS layer mappings and technology scaling.
Project settings are saved with the libraries and checked when those libraries are read back in.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The left side of the Preferences or Project Settings dialog is a tree-structured list of all of its
different panels.
The right side is the actual panel, which changes according to the panel requested.
Below the list of panels is a "Help" button which takes you to the proper manual page which explains that panel.
<P>
Preferences are stored permanently on your computer and are remembered each time you run Electric.
The actual location of this information varies with each operating system.
<UL>
<LI><B>Windows:</B>
In the registry.  Look in: HKEY_CURRENT_USER / Software / JavaSoft / Prefs / com / sun / electric.
</LI>
<LI><B>UNIX/Linux:</B>
In your home directory.  Look in: ~/.java/.userPrefs/com/sun/electric
</LI>
<LI><B>Macintosh:</B>
In your home directory, under Library/Preferences.  Look at: ~/Library/Preferences/com.sun.electric.plist
</LI>
</UL>
You can delete the appropriate data to reset Electric to its "factory" state.
<P>
You can export your preferences to disk for ease of saving and transporting.
Use the "Export" button in the dialog,
or with the <B>Preferences...</B> command (in menu <B>File / Export</B>).
These will write an XML file with preference information.
This XML file can be read back into Electric's preferences with the
"Import" button, or with the <B>Preferences...</B> command (in menu <B>File / Import</B>).
<P>
Project settings can be exported with the <B>Project Settings...</B> command (in menu <B>File / Export</B>).
This writes an XML file with project setting information.
This XML file can be read back into Electric with the
<B>Project Settings...</B> command (in menu <B>File / Import</B>).

<P>
Electric stores Project Settings in every library file so that,
when read back in, these settings can be reconciled with current settings.
When a library is read that has different Project Settings, this dialog appears:
<P>

<P>
You must choose whether you want to use the setting value from the library (recommended)
or the current setting.
This can be done on an individual-setting basis, or for all settings that conflict.

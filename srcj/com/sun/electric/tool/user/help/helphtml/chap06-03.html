Preferences are stored permanently on your computer and are remembered each time you run Electric.
The actual location of this information varies with each operating system.

In the registry.  Look in: HKEY_CURRENT_USER / Software / JavaSoft / Prefs / com / sun / electric.

<P>
There are two types of preferences: <I>appearance</I> and <I>meaning</I>.
Appearance preferences affect only the way Electric appears when run, and do not affect the actual circuitry.
Meaning preferences affect the interpretation of the data, and therefore their settings are critical to your design.
<P>
Electric stores meaning preferences in every library file so that,
when read back in, the preferences can be reconciled with current settings.
When a library is read that has different preferences, this dialog appears:

You must choose whether you want to use the preference value from the library (recommended)
or the current setting.
This can be done on an individual-preference basis, or for all preferences that conflict.

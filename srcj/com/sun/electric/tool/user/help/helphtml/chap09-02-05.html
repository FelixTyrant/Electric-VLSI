<P>
Four types of errors are detected by the incremental and hierarchical design-rule checkers.
<I>Spacing</I> errors are caused by geometry that is too close, but not connected.
<I>Notch</I> errors are caused by geometry that is too close, but connected.
<I>Minimum size</I> errors are caused by geometry that is too small.
<I>Resolution</I> errors are caused by geometries that are smaller than a requested resolution amount.
<P>
In addition to examining geometry,
the design-rule checkers use connectivity information to help find violations.
This use of network information helps the designer to debug circuit connectivity.
For example, if two overlapping nodes are not joined by an arc,
they may be considered to be in violation,
even if their geometry looks right.
This is because the checkers know what is connected and have a separate set of rules for such situations.
<P>
To help guide the design-rule checker,
a "cloaking" layer can be placed over areas that are not to be examined.
This cloaking layer is created by clicking the "Misc." entry of the component menu
and selecting "DRC Exclusion".
Any errors that fall inside of this node's area are ignored. 
<P>
To edit the design rules, use the "Design Rules"
preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Technology" section, ""Design Rules" tab). 
The dialog allows you to examine and modify the spacing limits for the current technology.
It is divided into two parts: "Layers" and "Nodes" (the radio buttons in the upper-left).
<P>
When "Nodes" are selected, you may set the minimum size of each node in the current technology.
<P>
When "Layers" are selected, you may set the minimum size of each layer as well as inter-layer spacing
(between that and the "To Layer").
Use the "Show only lines with rules" to restrict the displayed rules to those with valid values.
Each spacing rule comes in two flavors: connected and unconnected.
<P>

<P>
The connected rules apply to two different layers that are electrically connected;
the unconnected rules apply to unconnected layers.
A special Edge rule applies only to unconnected layers and ignores overlap when considering spacing distance.
The connected and unconnected rules come in three styles: normal, wide, and multiple cut.
The Wide rules apply when either layer is wider than a specified amount.
The Multiple cut rules apply when either layer is part of a multi-cut contact.
In addition to specifying a spacing distance,
you can give a description of the rule that will be reported by the design-rule checker.
The "Factory Reset" button restores all rules to the original set built into Electric.
<P>

You can request that resolution errors be checked during DRC
by checking "Find resolution errors".
The "Output resolution" field is the minimum coordinate value that may exist.
All geometry of that size or less will be flagged as resolution errors.
For example, current MOSIS rules require that no boundaries be quarter-lambda or less,
so a value of .25 in this field will detect such violations.
<P>
Note that the MOSIS CMOS design rule 6.7b is not checked by Electric
because it is difficult to detect properly.
This error is never fatal,
and the worst case of missing this error is that active and poly are closer by 1/2 lambda,
which merely results in an increase in capacitive coupling between them.
If this fringing capacitance is important,
you've probably got so much polysilicon in your circuit that it has bigger problems.

<P>
Electric is able to read the output of Cadence's Assura design-rule checker.
These error files (with the extension ".err") can be read with the
<B>Import Assura DRC Errors...</B> command (in menu <B>Tool / DRC</B>).
After reading the error file,
you can review the errors by typing "&gt;" and "&lt;" to step to the next and previous error that was found.
You can also see a list of errors in the cell explorer (see <A HREF="chap04-08.html#chap04-08">Section 4-8</A>).

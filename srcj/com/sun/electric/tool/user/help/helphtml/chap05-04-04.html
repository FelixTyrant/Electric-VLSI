<!-- HEADER 5-4-4: Naming -->

Another property of an arc is its name.
This is a character string that is displayed on the arc and used to name the electrical network connected to that arc.
The "Name" field in the <B>Get Info</B> dialog allows you to specify this property,
which is then displayed on the arc.
Note that creating exports is another way of naming a network.

<!-- HEADER 3-7-4: The Cell Explorer -->

The <B>Cell Explorer...</B> command of the <B>Cells</B> menu splits the current window,
and shows a hierarchical "explorer" window in the left half.
Another way to get the cell explorer is to click on the "tree" icon in the lower-left of the window.
<P>
The explorer window has 3 sections: the Hierarchical View, Contents View, and Errors View.

The Hierarchical View of the cell explorer lists only the "top level" cells of each library
(top level cells are those that are not used as instances in any other cells).
By clicking on the box with the "+", the cell's contents are shown in a recursively indented manner.
Each cell lists the number of times that it occurs in the higher-level cell.
<P>
The Contents View of the cell explorer lists every cell in every library.
Inside of each cell is a list of arcs, exports, networks, and nodes.
When editing technology-edit libraries, the Contents View breaks down the library according to layers, nodes, and arcs.
<P>
The third part of the Cell Explorer is the Errors View.
This lists all errors that were generated by other tools (DRC, ERC, NCC, etc.)
and which are normally presented with the "<" and ">" keys.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Any text shown in the Cell Explorer can be copied (and pasted to another document) by selecting a line and using the
<B>Copy</B> command.
In both the Contents and Hierarchical View, you can double-click on any object to see it in the other half of the window.
Double-clicking on a cell shows that cell.
Clicking a cell and typing the DELETE key deletes that cell.
Double-clicking on a library name makes that library the current one.
<P>
In addition, the Cell Explorer uses a "context menu" that is accessed by right-clicking on an entry
(use command-click on the Macintosh).
The context menu offers special operations,
for example the ability to recursively open or close all entries below the current one.
<P>
The line which separates the Cell Explorer from the edit window can be moved simply by clicking on it and dragging it
(see <A HREF="chap04-03.html#chap04-03">Section 4-3</A> for more on window control).
To make the Cell Explorer go away,
delete that window partition, click on the tree icon again, or issue the <B>Cell Explorer...</B> command again.
<P>
The font size of text in the Cell Explorer can be set in the "Cell explorer text size"
field of the <B>Cell Options...</B> dialog.

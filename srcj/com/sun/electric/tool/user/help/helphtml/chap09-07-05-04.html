<!-- HEADER 9-7-5-4: NCC GUI: Sizes -->

<P>
Both length and width mismatches in
transistor and resistor sizes are collected under "Sizes [X]" node, where
"X" is the total number of size
mismatches. Resistor size mismatches are reported here, because
Polysilicon resistors in both schematics and layout have lengths and
widths.</P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">Figure 10: The size
mismatches table is sorted in the descending order of the relative
error</FONT></P>

<P>
On the right side of the window,
mismatches are arranged into a table sorted in the descending order
of the relative error (Figure 10). Each mismatch occupies one row and
has four columns. The first column contains the relative error of the
mismatch. The second and third columns have widths and lengths of the
corresponding parts in two cells. The mismatched value is printed in
red. The last column has hyperlinked part names.</P>

<P>
If a transistor has both a length and a
width mismatch, then these mismatches are displayed in separate rows
(e.g. the first and the second rows in Figure 10).</P>

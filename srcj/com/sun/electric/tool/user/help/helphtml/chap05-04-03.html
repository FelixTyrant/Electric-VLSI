All arcs are drawn so that their geometry extends beyond their endpoints by one-half of their width.
This property can be set or reset with the <B>Toggle End Extension</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Arc</B>
).
It may also be controlled by checking the appropriate box in the <B>Object Properties...</B> dialog.

Individual ends of an arc may be controlled with the <B>Toggle Head-Skip</B> and <B>Toggle Tail-Skip</B> commands,
or by checking the "Ignore head" and "Ignore tail" boxes in the <B>Object Properties...</B> dialog.
When an end has been ignored, the property associated with it does not occur.
This means that directional arcs have their arrowhead omitted (when the head is ignored);
negated arcs do not have the bubble drawn (when the tail is ignored);
and arcs with their ends not extended have that end extended.

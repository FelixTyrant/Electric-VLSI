<!-- HEADER 1-11-5: Schematics Example: MultiInput gates and Negation -->

One aspect of the And, Or, and Xor gates that you will notice is that their left side
(the input side) can accept any number of wires.
To see this in action, place one of these components in the cell.
Then repeatedly select its left side and use the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:right  Windows:right  Mac:cmd-click">creation</A></I> button to draw wires out of it.
After three wires have been connected to the input side,
the gate grows to accommodate more.
Note that the vertical cursor location along the input side is used to select the position that will be used when a new wire is added.

To negate an input or output of a digital gate,
you must negate the wire connected to that gate.
Select a wire and use the <B>Negated</B> command from the <B>Arc</B> menu.
With this facility, you can construct arbitrary gate configurations.

<!-- HEADER 6-2: Creation Defaults -->

The <B>Duplicate</B> command is useful because a node may have been modified (rotated,
scaled, etc.) and duplication preserves all of those changes.
Using <B>Copy</B> and <B>Paste</B> does the same thing.
Another way to create nodes that are nonstandard is to set creation defaults.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
To do this, use the "New Nodes" tab of the "General" section of the <B>Preferences...</B> command of the <B>File</B> menu.
The top part of the dialog controls primitive nodes.
You can change the default size of any primitive node in the current technology by choosing the node and changing the values.

<P>
The middle section of the dialog controls cells.
The check box "Check Cell dates during editing"
requests that date information be used to ensure a proper circuit building sequence.
When this box is checked, warning messages will be issued when editing a cell that has more recent subcell instances.
Electric tracks cell creation and revision dates, and this information can be displayed with the
<B>Describe this Cell</B> subcommand and others in the <B>Cell Info</B> command of the <B>Cell</B> menu. 
<P>
The check box "Switch technology to match current cell"
requests that the current technology automatically change whenever the current cell changes so that the two match. 
<P>
The check box "Place Cell-Center in new cells" requests that all newly created cells have a Cell-Center node
placed at the origin (see <A HREF="chap03-03.html#chap03-03">Section 3-3</A> for more on Cell centers). 
<P>
The bottom part of the dialog applies to all nodes.
<P>
The check box "Disallow modification of locked primitives" requests that all lockable primitive node instances be anchored.
Once locked, these nodes cannot be created, deleted,
or modified in any way.
Typically, only primitives in "array" technologies are lockable
(such as the FPGA technology),
presuming that these components will be used to define the fixed circuitry that is then customized.
Design of the fixed circuitry is done with this lock off,
and then the customization phase is done with this lock on.
<P>
The check box "Move after Duplicate" allows duplicated objects to be positioned interactively.
This is the default condition.
However, if this is unchecked,
then the <B>Duplicate</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu will place a copy automatically,
without allowing the new location to be specified by the cursor.
This has the advantage that it learns the location to use from past actions,
so repeated <B>Duplicate</B> commands can be used to automatically place things regularly.
<P>
The check box "Duplicate/Array/Paste copies exports" requests that all node-copying operations also copy their exports.
This includes the <B>Duplicate</B>, <B>Array</B>, and <B>Paste</B> commands of the <B>Edit</B>
.
By default, exports are not copied with their nodes.
<P>
The check box "Extract copies exports" requests that extraction of cell instances also copy the exports.
Extraction is done with the <B>Extract Cell Instance</B> command of the <B>Cell</B> menu.
By default, exports are not copied during extraction.

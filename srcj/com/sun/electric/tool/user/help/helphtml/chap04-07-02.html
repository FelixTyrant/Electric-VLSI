<!-- HEADER 4-7-2: Aligning to a Grid -->

When moving or creating circuitry,
the cursor location is snapped to a grid so that editing is cleaner.
This snapping is controlled by the alignment options
(which are not necessarily the same as the grid options).

The <B>Alignment Options...</B> command presents a dialog in which alignment values may be set.
For example, if the grid spacing is 2x3, and the alignment is 0.5,
then there are up to six different positions for placement inside a displayed grid rectangle.

<P>
A special grid setting is the alignment of edges, which initially is set to zero
(no alignment).
This alignment affects the edges of nodes and arcs
(as opposed to their lower-left corner, where the grab-point resides).
For example, if a 3 lambda wide wire is drawn into a 4x4 contact,
the default will be to center that wire, which will
place the edges of the wire on half-lambda grid locations.
If, however, the edge alignment is set to 1 lambda,
then that wire will be forced to one side of the contact so that its edges align.
Note that it is not always possible to align edges properly,
so you should always check your geometry if you insist on this feature.
<P>
The <B>Align to Grid</B> subcommand of the <B>Move</B> command of the <B>Edit</B>
menu cleans up the selected objects by moving them to aligned coordinates.
This is useful for circuitry that has been imported from external sources,
and needs to be placed cleanly for further editing.

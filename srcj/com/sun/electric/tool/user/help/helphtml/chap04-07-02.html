<!-- HEADER 4-7-2: Aligning to a Grid -->

<!-- COMMAND Edit/Move/Align to Grid -->

When moving or creating circuitry,
the cursor location is snapped to a grid so that editing is cleaner.
This snapping is controlled by the alignment options
(which are not necessarily the same as the grid options).

The <B>Preferences...</B> command of the <B>File</B> menu,
in the "Grid" tab of the "Display" section,
presents a dialog in which alignment values may be set.
For example, if the grid spacing is 2x3, and the alignment is 0.5,
then there are up to six different positions for placement inside a displayed grid rectangle.

<P>
The <B>Align to Grid</B> subcommand of the <B>Move</B> command of the <B>Edit</B>
menu cleans up the selected objects by moving them to aligned coordinates.
This is useful for circuitry that has been imported from external sources,
and needs to be placed cleanly for further editing.

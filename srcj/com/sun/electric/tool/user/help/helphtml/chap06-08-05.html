<!-- HEADER 6-8-5: Text Attributes -->

You can place arbitrary text attributes on nearly any part of the circuit by using the <B>Define...</B>
subcommand of the <B>Attributes</B> command of the <B>Info</B> menu.
<P>

<P>
Attributes can be placed on these objects (selected in the upper-left):
<UL>
<LI>The current cell.
<LI>The currently selected node.
<LI>Any of the exports in the current cell
(select the particular export from the list in the upper-right).
<LI>Any of the ports on the current selected node
(select the particular port from the list in the upper-right).
<LI>The currently selected arc.
</UL>
The list of attributes is shown on the left.
You can create a new attribute by typing its name in the "Attribute name:"
field and its value in the "Value:" field and then clicking the "Create Attribute" button.
You can delete an attribute with the "Delete Attribute" button.
A selected attribute can have its value changed by typing a new value and clicking the "Change Value" button.
An attribute's name can be changed with the "Rename Attribute" button.
<P>
Just below the attribute's value is a field that reads "Not Code".
This can be changed to one of the interpretive languages in Electric.
When this happens, the attribute value is treated as code that is sent to that interpreter.
Then, the true value of the attribute is the evaluation of that code.
For example, if the value of an attribute is "(+ 3 5)" and the attribute is set to be LISP code,
then the LISP interpreter will be invoked, and the attribute will actually be "8".
For more on interpretive languages, see <A HREF="chap11-01.html#chap11-01">Section 11-1</A>.
<P>
You can change the type of unit by using the popup menu on the bottom
(choices are capacitance, resistance, inductance, current, voltage, or distance).
See section <A HREF="chap07-02.html#chap07-02">Section 7-2</A> for more on these units.
<P>
For attributes on cells or exports,
you can request that they be inheritable with the "Instances inherit" checkbox.
When this is checked, newly created instances of the cell will have copies of this attribute on them.
Using this scheme, an attribute can be considered to be a <I>parameter</I>,
where values set on the instances are used inside of the cell.
The "Is Parameter" checkbox should be selected in this case
(note that the proper way to create parameters is with the <B>Cell Parameters...</B> subcommand, not this dialog).
If you check "Visible only inside cell" in the attribute's <B>Get Info</B> dialog,
then the inherited attributes will not be displayed.
<P>
It is often desirable to have attribute values that have unique names.
If the value of an inherited attribute has "++" in it,
then the number before it will be incremented after inheritance.
Similarly, a "--" indicates that the number be decremented after inheritance.
This allows an inherited attribute to be unique with each inheritance.
<P>
If you create a new inheritable attribute and wish to propagate it to existing instances,
select the instance and use the <B>Update Inheritance</B> subcommand of the <B>Attributes</B> command of the <B>Info</B> menu.
To propagate attributes to all instances, use <B>Update Inheritance All Libraries</B>.
<P>
You can control the way that an attribute is displayed in the circuit by selecting the appropriate entry in the "Show:" popup.
You can request that various combinations of the attribute's name, value, and inherited value be displayed.
When an attribute is shown, additional information is relevant.
The grab-point of the text can be chosen from the list in the lower-right.
The X and Y offset of the text from the attached object can be specified.
The size of the text can be specified in relative or absolute units.
The font of the text can be chosen from the popup list.
The style of the text can be any combination of Italic, Bold, or Underline.
You can even specify the orientation of the text, in 90-degree increments.
<P>
When there are too many visible attributes, the display can become cluttered.
Use the <B>Layer Visibility</B> command of the <B>Windows</B> menu to control the text.
(attributes on nodes are controlled by the "Node Text" checkbox; those on arcs with the "Arc Text" checkbox, etc.)
<P>
Special buttons exist in the upper-right for applying changes to many ports or exports.
By using the "Add", "Remove", "Add All",
or "Remove All" buttons, you can select a subset of names (those with a ">" are selected).
Then, by using the "Make Array" button,
the currently selected attribute is copied to all selected locations.
<P>
The "Done" button terminates this dialog.
Note that there is no "Cancel" button: this dialog makes changes as they are entered.

The Logical Effort tool examines a digital schematic and determines the optimal transistor size to use in order to get maximum speed.
The tool is based on the book <A HREF="http://www.mkp.com/books_catalog/catalog.asp?ISBN=1-55860-557-6"><I>Logical Effort</I></A>,
by Ivan Sutherland, Bob Sproull, and David Harris (Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, 1999).

Besides setting the maximum stage gain for whole-cell analysis,
the dialog allows other settings.

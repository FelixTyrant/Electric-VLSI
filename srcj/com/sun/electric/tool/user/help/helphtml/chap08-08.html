The Logical Effort tool examines a digital schematic and determines the optimal transistor size to use in order to get maximum speed.
The tool is based on the book <A HREF="http://www.mkp.com/books_catalog/catalog.asp?ISBN=1-55860-557-6"><I>Logical Effort</I></A>,
by Ivan Sutherland, Bob Sproull, and David Harris (Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, 1999).

To control Logical Effort, use the
"Logical Effort" preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Logical Effort" tab)
Besides setting the maximum stage gain for whole-cell analysis,
the dialog allows other settings.

Note: It is highly recommended that the user is familiar with the concept of Logical Effort
as described in the above book before using the Logical Effort Tool in Electric.

Two commands may be given to the Logical Effort tool:
<H2>Optimize for Equal Gate Delays</H2>
<P>
Optimizes all Logical Effort gates (Cells) to have the same delay.  The delay is specified by the
Global fan-out (step-up) option.  A Logical Effort gate is simply a schematic or layout cell
that conforms to the following specifications:
<UL>
<LI>The Cell has an attribute "LEGATE" which is set to "1".
<LI>The Cell has only one output, which may have a logical effort attribute (explained below)
<LI>The Cell has zero or more inputs/bidirectional ports.  Each of these must have a
logical effort attribute (explained below)
<LI>The Cell has an attribute whose name does not matter, but whose value is "LE.getdrive()",
and whose code is set to "Java"
</UL>
<P>
On the inputs and output exports of the Cell, we can define an attribute named "le".  The value
of this attribute is the logical effort of that port.  For example, a NAND gate typically
has a logical effort on each input of 4/3, and an output logical effort of 2.
<P>
The size assigned to the logical effort gate is retrieve via the "LE.getdrive()" call. This value
can then be used to size transistors within the gate.  The size retrieve is scaled with respect
to the minimum sized inverter (as are all other logical effort parameters).  So a size of "1"
denotes a minimum sized inverter.
<P>
While these attributes are defined on the layout or schematic Cell *definition*, they must also
be present on the instantiated icon or instance of that definition.  By default they will be.
<P>
There are several advanced features that may be added to the Cell definition:
<UL>
<LI>Attribute "LEKEEPER=1". This Cell is now a keeper, whose size will be the size of the
smallest Logical Effort gate driving against it, multiplied by the Keeper Ratio.
<LI>Attribute "LEPARALLGRP=0". If set to 0, this gate drives by itself. If an integer greater
than zero, all gates of with that value whose outputs drive the same network are assumed to
drive in parallel. The size needed to drive the load on the network will be equally divided
amongst those gates.

When editing one view of a cell,
there are a set of commands in the <B>View</B> menu that will switch to an alternate view of the same cell.
<UL>
<LI>Use <B>Edit Layout View</B> to switch to the layout view.
<LI>Use <B>Edit Schematic View</B> to switch to the unnumbered schematic view.
<LI>Use <B>Edit Icon View</B> to switch to the Icon view.
<LI>Use <B>Edit VHDL View</B> to switch to the VHDL view.
<LI>Use <B>Edit Documentation View</B> to switch to the text-only documentation view.
<LI>Use <B>Edit Skeleton View</B> to switch to the Skeleton view.
</UL>
For all other view types, use <B>Edit Other View...</B> and select the desired view.
Note that these commands are equivalent to the <B>Edit Cell...</B> command (in menu <B>Cell</B>) with an appropriate selection.
<P>
When editing cells with text-only views, the window becomes a text editor.
You may then use the <B>Text Cell Context...</B> command (in menu <B>File / Export</B>)
and the <B>Text Cell Context...</B>
 command (in menu <B>File / Import</B>)
save and restore this text to disk.
See <A HREF="chap04-10.html#chap04-10">Section 4-10</A> for more on text editing.
<P>
The commands to edit another view work only when that cell exists.
To create a new cell of a particular type, use the <B>Make...</B> commands of the <B>View</B> menu.
These view conversion commands are available:
<UL>
<LI><B>Make Icon View</B> creates an icon from a schematic
(see <A HREF="chap03-11-04.html#chap03-11-04">Section 3-11-4</A> for more on this).
<LI><B>Make Schematic View</B> creates a schematic from a layout;.
<LI><B>Make Alternate Layout View...</B> converts from layout or schematic to layout.
You must choose a specific layout technology, and the new layout will use components from that technology.
<LI><B>Make Skeleton View</B> makes a skeletonized layout from a layout
(the only thing in the skeleton is the exports and the frame; it is a "layout icon").
</UL>

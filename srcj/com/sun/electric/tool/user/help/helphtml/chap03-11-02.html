<!-- HEADER 3-11-2: Switching between Views of a Cell -->

When editing one view of a cell,
there are a set of commands in the <B>View</B> menu that will switch to an alternate view of the same cell.
<UL>
<LI>Use <B>Edit Layout View</B> to switch to the layout view.
<LI>Use <B>Edit Schematic View</B> to switch to the unnumbered schematic view.
<LI>Use <B>Edit Multi-Page Schematic View...</B> to switch to a particular page of a multipage schematic
(this is the only command that can create new pages of a multipage schematic).
<LI>Use <B>Edit Icon View</B> to switch to the Icon view.
<LI>Use <B>Edit VHDL View</B> to switch to the VHDL view.
<LI>Use <B>Edit Documentation View</B> to switch to the text-only documentation view.
<LI>Use <B>Edit Skeleton View</B> to switch to the Skeleton view.
</UL>
For all other view types, use <B>Edit Other View...</B> and select the desired view.
Note that these commands are equivalent to the <B>Edit Cell...</B> command of the <B>Cells</B> menu with an appropriate selection.
<P>
When editing cells with text-only views, the window becomes a text editor.
You may then use the <B>Write Text Cell...</B> and <B>Read Text Cell...</B>
commands of the <B>Cells</B> menu to save and restore this text to disk.
See <A HREF="chap04-10.html#chap04-10">Section 4-10</A> for more on text editing.
<P>
The commands to edit another view work only when that cell exists.
To create a new cell of a particular type, use the <B>Make...</B> commands of the <B>View</B> menu.
Thus, <B>Make Multi-Page Schematic View...</B> creates a new page in a multi-page schematic.
<B>Make Documentation View</B> creates a blank documentation cell.
<B>Make Other View...</B> prompts for any view type and creates a cell with that view.
<P>
<H3>Creating and Deleting Views</H3>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
If the list of possible views is not sufficient to describe a cell,
new views can be created with the <B>New View Type...</B> command of the <B>View</B> menu.
This command requests a name and an abbreviation.
</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig03-07.png" ALT="Figure 3.7"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Generally, an abbreviation should be the first few letters of the full view name.
This abbreviation will be used when describing cells with that view.
For example, the view "fast-layout" might have the abbreviation "fast".
<P>
The "Textual View" checkbox indicates that this is a text-only view,
like "Documentation", "Netlist", "Verilog", and "VHDL".
<P>
To delete a view, use the <B>Delete View Type...</B> command of the <B>View</B> menu.
You can delete only the views that you have created, not the basic views that exist on startup
(such as "layout", "schematic", etc).
Also, there must be no cells with the view that is being deleted.

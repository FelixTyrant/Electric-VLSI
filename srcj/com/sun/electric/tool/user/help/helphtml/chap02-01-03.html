<!-- HEADER 2-1-3: Unusual Selection: Areas and Text -->

Besides highlighting nodes and arcs, Electric can also highlight an arbitrary rectangular area.
The notion of a <I>highlighted area</I>, as opposed to a <I>highlighted object</I>,
is used in some commands, and it generally implies highlighting of everything in the area.
<P>
There are two ways to highlight an area.
If you click the <I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:left  Windows:left  Mac:click">selection</A></I> button where there is no object,
and hold it down while dragging over objects, all of those objects will be highlighted.
If you need to start the area over an existing object,
first deselect everything and then use the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:shift-left  Windows:shift-left  Mac:shift-click">toggle select</A></I> button.
<P>
To more precisely define a highlighted area, drag a rectangle using the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:meta-right  Windows:alt-right  Mac:cmd-opt-click">rectangle select</A></I> button.
This leaves the highlight rectangle on the screen exactly as it was drawn.
You can convert this selection to a set of actual nodes and arcs with the <B>Enclosed Objects</B> subcommand of the
<B>Selection</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
<P>
<H3>Selecting Text</H3>
<P>
<I>Highlighted text</I> appears as an "X" over the letters.
However, text is a special case, so it will not be covered until later
(<A HREF="chap06-08.html#chap06-08">section 6-8</A>).
For now, if you highlight some text, it is best to click again and select something else.

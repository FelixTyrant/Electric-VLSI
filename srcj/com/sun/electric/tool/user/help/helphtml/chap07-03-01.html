<!-- HEADER 7-3-1: I/O Specifications -->

Electric is able to read and write circuits in a number of different formats.
This is done with the <B>Import</B> and the <B>Export</B> commands of the <B>File</B> menu
(see <A HREF="chap03-09.html#chap03-09">Section 3-9</A>).
To properly control translation, the <B>IO Options</B>
command has many subcommands for the different file types.
<P>
Unfortunately, many of these formats are pure geometry with no information about the circuit connections.
When read, the input formatter creates pure-layer nodes to describe the geometry.
This means that transistors, contacts, and other multi-layer nodes are not constructed properly.
Although the cell appears visually correct,
and can be used to export the same type of file,
it cannot be analyzed at a circuit level.
<P>
A partial solution to this problem exists now.
The <B>Node Extract</B> subcommand of the <B>Network</B> command of the <B>Tools</B>
menu will replace the pure-layer nodes in the current cell with connected nodes and arcs.
It isn't guaranteed to work in all situations, and it doesn't recognize transistors at all.
However, it starts the conversion process (which must be completed by hand).
Also, the code is available and some enterprising programmer may want to finish (or rewrite) it.

Electric is able to read and write circuits in a number of different formats.
This is done with the <B>Import</B> and the <B>Export</B> commands (in menu <B>File</B>).
See <A HREF="chap03-09-02.html#chap03-09-02">Section 3-9-2</A> for more on Import;
see <A HREF="chap03-09-03.html#chap03-09-03">Section 3-9-3</A> for more on Export.

To properly control translation,
use the many preferences dialogs for the different file types
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "I/O" section).

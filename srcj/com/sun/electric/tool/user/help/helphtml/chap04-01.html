<!-- HEADER 4-1: Introduction to The Display -->

Nearly every aspect of the display can be controlled.
There are commands to manipulate the editing windows, menus, colors, and more.
<P>
One useful feature of the display is that drawing can be aborted by typing the interrupt key
(Ctrl-C on UNIX,
<IMG SRC="iconwindows.png" ALT="CMD">C on Windows,
<IMG SRC="iconcommand.png" ALT="CMD-">. on the Macintosh;
see <A HREF="chap01-09.html#chap01-09">Section 1-9</A>).
This helps if a long and complex display operation begins that need not finish.
<P>
Electric is able to display multiple editing windows,
and these windows can be subdivided repeatedly.
<P>
If a window appears incorrect,
you can redraw it with the <B>Redisplay Window</B> command of the <B>Windows</B> menu.

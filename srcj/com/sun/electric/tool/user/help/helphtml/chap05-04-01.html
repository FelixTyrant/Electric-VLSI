<!-- HEADER 5-4-1: Directionality -->

<TABLE><TR><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig05-07.png" ALT="Figure 5.7"></CENTER></TD><TD>
For documentation purposes, it is possible to display a <I>directional</I> arrow on arcs that indicates flow.
This property can be set or reset with the <B>Directional</B> command of the <B>Arc</B> menu.
It may also be controlled by checking the appropriate box in the <B>Get Info</B> command of the <B>Info</B> menu.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
The arrow always runs from the tail of the arc to the head of the arc unless you reverse the arc
(with the <B>Reverse</B> command of the <B>Arc</B> menu or by checking the "Reverse head and tail" box in the <B>Get Info</B> dialog).
If the head of the arc is "skipped" (with the <B>Skip Head</B> command or by checking the appropriate box
in the <B>Get Info</B> dialog), then the arrow head is not drawn.

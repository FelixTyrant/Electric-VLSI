<TABLE><TR><TD>
To get some basic information about the current cell
(size, dates, etc) use the <B>Describe this Cell</B> command
(in menu <B>Cell / Cell Info</B>).
<P>
To get information about more than one cell, use the <B>General Cell Lists...</B> command.
The dialog selects a subset of the cells in the current library.
<P>
The section labeled "Which cells:" selects the cells to be listed
(all, only those used in other cells,
only those NOT used in the current cell,
only those in the current cell,
or only "placeholder" cells: those created because of cross-library dependency failures).
<P>
The section labeled "View filter:" allows only certain views to be displayed.
<P>
The section labeled "Version filter:" allows removal of older or newer versions of cells.
<P>
The section labeled "Display ordering:" controls the order in which the selected cells will be listed.
<P>
The section labeled "Destination:" allows you to dump this listing to a disk file,
formatted for spreadsheets (tab-separated).

<P>
The last five columns show the usage and four state bits.
The usage is the number of times that this cell appears as an instance in other cells.
The state bits are:
<UL>
<LI>"L" if the cell contents are locked</LI>
<LI>"I" if instances in the cell are locked</LI>
<LI>"C" if the cell is part of a cell library</LI>
<LI>"D" if the cell has passed design-rule checking</LI>
</UL>
<P>
For more cell information, use the commands of menu <B>Cell / Cell Info</B>.
The <B>List Nodes in this Cell</B> command shows all nonprimitive nodes in the current cell.
The <B>List Cell Instances</B> command shows all cell instances below the current cell.
The <B>List Cell Usage</B> command looks up the hierarchy and finds cells that contain the
current cell as an instance.

<P>
The <B>Edit Documentation View</B> command (of menu <B>View</B>) allows you to store arbitrary text with the cell.
The text editing window that appears can contain any information.
See <A HREF="chap04-10.html#chap04-10">Section 4-10</A> for more on text editing.
<P>
The <B>List Layer Coverage on Cell</B> command (in menu <B>Cell / Cell Info</B>) computes the percentage of the cell that is covered by each layer.
This is useful information for certain fabrication processes which insist on a minimum amount of each layer in the die.

The scale of a window's contents can be controlled in a number of ways.
The <B>Zoom In</B> command of the <B>Window</B> menu zooms in, magnifying the contents of the display.
The <B>Zoom Out</B> command does the opposite - it shrinks the display.
Both zoom by a factor of two.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
You can also use the Zoom tool from the tool bar to zoom in and out.
To zoom into an area, click and drag out that area.
To zoom out, hold the shift key and click in the center of the desired area.

<P>
The most useful scale change command is <B>Fill Window</B> of the <B>Window</B> menu,
which makes the current cell fill the window.
<P>
To examine a specific area of the display, use the <B>Focus on Highlighted</B> subcommand of the <B>Special Zoom</B> command,
which makes the highlighted objects fill the display.
To examine a specific area of the display that is not necessarily aligned with nodes and arcs,
use the area select commands (see <A HREF="chap02-01-03.html#chap02-01-03">section 2-1-3</A>).
You can also use the <B>Zoom Box</B> subcommand of the <B>Special Zoom</B> command,
which allows you to drag-out a rectangle, and then zooms to that area.
<P>
The <B>Make Grid Just Visible</B> subcommand of the <B>Special Zoom</B> command zooms (in or out) until the grid
is minimally visible.
Any futher zoom-out from this point will make the grid invisible.
If the grid is not being displayed, it is turned on.
<P>
A final scaling command is <B>Match Other Window</B> which redraws the current window at the same scale as the other.
If there are more than two windows, you will be asked to select the window to match.

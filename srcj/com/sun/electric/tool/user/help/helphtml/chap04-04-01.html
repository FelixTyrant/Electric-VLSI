<!-- HEADER 4-4-1: Scaling -->

The scale of a window's contents can be controlled in a number of ways.
The <B>Zoom In</B> command of the <B>Windows</B> menu zooms in, magnifying the contents of the display.
The <B>Zoom Out</B> command does the opposite - it shrinks the display.
Both zoom by a factor of two.
<P>
The most useful scale change command is <B>Fill Window</B> of the <B>Windows</B> menu,
which makes the current cell fill the window.
<P>
To examine a specific area of the display, use the <B>Focus on Highlighted</B> subcommand of the <B>Special Zoom</B> command,
which makes the highlighted objects fill the display.
To examine a specific area of the display that is not necessarily aligned with nodes and arcs,
use the <I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:shift-meta-right  Windows:shift-alt-right  Mac:shift-cmd-opt-click">rectangle zoom</A></I> button,
which allows you to drag-out a rectangle, and then zooms to that area.
You can zoom to a specific area in a single step by using the <B>Highlight then Focus</B> subcommand,
which lets you drag an area and then zooms to that area.
<P>
The <B>Make Grid Just Visible</B> subcommand of the <B>Special Zoom</B> command zooms (in or out) until the grid
is minimally visible.
Any futher zoom-out from this point will make the grid invisible.
If the grid is not being displayed, it is turned on.
<P>
A final scaling command is <B>Match Other Window</B> which redraws the current window at the same scale as the other.
If there are more than two windows, you will be asked to select the window to match.

<!-- HEADER 7-5-2: Multipage Schematics and Frames -->

Multipage schematics are provided in Electric by having different views for each page.
Thus, you can have cells called "Timer{p1}" and "Timer{p2}" which are pages 1 and 2 of the Timer schematic.
To create these cells, use the <B>Edit Multi-Page Schematic View...</B> command (in menu <B>View</B>).
<P>
As a graphical aid to schematic design, frames can be displayed in a cell by using the <B>Cell Properties...</B>
command (in menu <B>Cell</B>).

The frame size can be "Half-A", "A", "B", "C", "D",
and "E".
The frame can be horizontal (landscale) or vertical (portrait).
You can choose to display a title box in the lower-right corner.
The designer name can also be set for each cell.

<P>
Besides the designer name, cell frames have a company name and a project name.
These values are not set for each cell, but instead are preferences that
are set for each user.
Individual libraries can override these defaults as well.

<TABLE><TR><TD>
<P>
The "Frame" preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Display" section, "Frame" tab)
lets you set all of these defaults.
Note that the designer name is taken first from the cell,
then from the library if the cell does not set a value, and finally from the general default
if the library and cell do not set a value.

<!-- HEADER 7-5-2: Multipage Schematics and Frames -->

Multipage schematics are provided in Electric by having different views for each page.
Thus, you can have cells called "Timer{p1}" and "Timer{p2}" which are pages 1 and 2 of the Timer schematic.
To create these cells, use the <B>Edit Multi-page Schematic View...</B> command of the <B>Views</B> menu.
<P>
As a graphical aid to schematic design, frames can be displayed in a cell by using the <B>Frame Options...</B>
command of the <B>View</B> menu.
<TABLE><TR><TD>
<P>
The "Half-A", "A", "B", "C", "D",
and "E" size frames are available in both landscape and portrait mode.
You can also choose to display a title box in the lower-right corner.
</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig07-20.png" ALT="Figure 07-20"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
In the title box, the cell name and date are shown.
You can also add information about the designer, company, and project.
This information can be set as a default for all design,
and can be overridden on a per-library basis.

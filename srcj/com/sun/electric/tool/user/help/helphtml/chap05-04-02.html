Arcs in the Schematic technology may be <I>negated</I>,
which causes them to have a bubble drawn where they attach to schematic elements.
This property can be changed with the <B>Toggle Port Negation</B> subcommand of the
<B>Technology Specific</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
It may also be controlled by checking the appropriate box in the <B>Object Properties...</B> dialog.

<P>
Although Electric attempts to place the bubble on the correct end of the arc,
it can be reversed with the <B>Reverse</B> subcommand of the <B>Arc</B>
command or by checking the appropriate box in the <B>Object Properties...</B> dialog.
<P>
If the tail of the arc is "skipped" (with the <B>Toggle Tail-Skip</B> subcommand of the
<B>Arc</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu, or by checking the appropriate box
in the <B>Object Properties...</B> dialog), then the negating bubble is not drawn.
Beware of doing this, because the negation is still part of the arc, even though it is not visible.
Negated arcs make no sense in layout technologies and are ignored.

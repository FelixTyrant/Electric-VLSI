<!-- HEADER 5-4-2: Negation -->

<TABLE><TR><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig05-09.png" ALT="Figure 5.9"></CENTER></TD><TD>
Arcs in the Schematic technology may be <I>negated</I>,
which causes them to have a bubble drawn where they attach to schematic elements.
This property can be set or reset with the <B>Negated</B> command of the <B>Arc</B> menu.
It may also be controlled by checking the appropriate box in the <B>Get Info</B> dialog.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Although Electric attempts to place the bubble on the correct end of the arc,
it can be reversed with the <B>Reverse</B> command of the <B>Arc</B>
menu or by checking the appropriate box in the <B>Get Info</B> dialog.
Note that there can be only one negating bubble on an arc,
so users who want two must use two arcs, connected by a pin.
<P>
If the tail of the arc is "skipped" (with the <B>Skip Tail</B> command or by checking the appropriate box
in the <B>Get Info</B> dialog), then the negating bubble is not drawn.
Beware of doing this, because the negation is still part of the arc, even though it is not visible.
Negated arcs make no sense in layout technologies and are ignored.

<!-- COMMAND Edit/Undo -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Redo -->

Electric has an undo mechanism that tracks all changes made during a session.
When a command is issued, it and its side effects are stored.
<P>
The <B>Undo</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu reverses the last change made
(this includes any changes that may have been made by other tools).
Multiple uses of the <B>Undo</B> command continue to undo further back.
The <B>Redo</B> command redoes changes, up to the most recent change made.

You can also use the undo (counterclockwise) and redo (clockwise) icons from the tool bar.

<P>
Electric stores only the last 20 changes, so anything older than that cannot be undone.
<P>
In Electric, almost every command is undoable, but there are some exceptions.
Commands that write disk files are not undoable,
because Electric would not be so presumptuous as to delete a disk file.
Also commands that make vast changes (such as library or technology deletion)
are not undoable.

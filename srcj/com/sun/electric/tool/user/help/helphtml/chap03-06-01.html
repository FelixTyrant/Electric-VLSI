<!-- HEADER 3-6-1: Export Creation -->

All nodes in Electric have connection sites, called <I>ports</I>,
which indicate where wires may be attached.
The primitive nodes have predefined ports,
but ports on cell instances must be defined by the user.
To do this, simply select a port on a node inside the cell,
and turn it into an <I>export</I>,
which makes it available on all instances of the current cell.
Although most ports are on nodes along the edge of the cell,
Electric makes no port location restrictions,
so they may appear anywhere.
<P>
To see the location of all ports on the selected nodes, use the <B>Show Ports on Node</B>
command of the <B>Export</B> menu.
To see all exports that have been defined in the current cell,
use the <B>Show Exports</B> command of the <B>Export</B> menu.
The <B>List Exports</B> command gives the same information, but in text form and the <B>Summarize Exports</B>
command gives a text list that is reduced where sensible.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
To create an export,
select a port on a node and use the <B>Create Export...</B> command of the <B>Export</B> menu.
The resulting dialog requests an export name and some characteristics.

<P>
All export names on a cell must be unique;
if a nonunique name is given, it is modified to be unique.
This modification involves adding "_1", "_2", etc. to the end of scalar export names,
or changing the index (from [1] to [2], etc.) for indexed export names.
Like cell names, export names may not contain spaces,
tabs, or unprintable characters.
Although no case distinction is made between uppercase and lowercase characters,
the original case usage is preserved.
<P>
Behavioral characteristics can be associated with an export by selecting the appropriate field in the export creation dialog.
These behavior characteristics are stored with the export and used primarily by simulators.
The characteristics include the following:
<UL>
<LI>Directional: "input", "output", and "bidirectional".
<LI>Supply: "power" and "ground".
<LI>Clocking: "clock" (a generic clock export) and "clock phase 1" through "clock phase 6".
<LI>Reference: "reference input", "reference output", and "reference base".
In addition, reference exports carry an associated export name that is used by the CIF netlister.
</UL>
<P>
The "Always drawn" check box requests that the export label should always appear,
regardless of the connection or expansion of its cell.
Typically, an export label on an instance of a cell is not displayed when that port is connected to an arc or when the instance is expanded.
This check box overrides the suppression.
<P>
Another special check box, "Body only," requests that this export not appear when an icon is generated for the cell.
This is useful for power and ground exports or duplicate connection sites on a single network.
<P>
There are three special exporting commands that are primarily used in array-based layout.
If a cell instance is replicated many times and the instances are wired together,
then ports on the edge of the array are the only ones that are not wired.
These ports define the connections for the next level of hierarchy.
What you want to do is to create exports for all unwired ports on all cell instances.
To do this, use the <B>Re-Export Everything</B> command of the <B>Export</B> menu,
which generates unique names as it exports all unwired ports on cell instances.
To do this same function, but only on the currently highlighted nodes, use <B>Re-Export Highlighted</B>.
To do this same function, but only for Power and Ground exports, use <B>Re-Export Power and Ground</B>.
Note that ports on primitive nodes are not exported with these commands.
See <A HREF="chap06-04.html#chap06-04">Section 6-4</A> for more about arrays,
and see <A HREF="chap09-05.html#chap09-05">Section 9-5</A> for more on automatic wiring.
<P>
Another special case in export creation is the <B>Add Export from Library...</B> command,
which copies exports from another library to the current one.
The other library is examined for cells whose names match ones in the current library.
When a cell is found in the other library,
all of its exports are copied to the cell in the current library
(if they don't already exist) and placed in the same location.
This command is useful in managing standard cell libraries that are imported from other file formats
(see <A HREF="chap03-09.html#chap03-09">Section 3-9</A> on Standard Cell Libraries).
Because some formats contain geometry and others contain connectivity,
this command is needed to put them together.

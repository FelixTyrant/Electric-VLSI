<!-- COMMAND Tool/Simulation (Built-in)/Set Signal High at Main Time -->
<!-- PREFERENCE Tools/Simulators -->

Since the IRSIM engine is running inside of Electric, you can place stimuli on the circuit
and see the results immediately.
<P>
You can select either a waveform or the equivalent network in the original schematic or layout.
Once selected, use the <B>Set Signal High at Main Time</B>
(in menu <B>Tool / Simulation (Built-in)</B>)
to make that signal go to "high" at the time indicated by the Main cursor.
Use <B>Set Signal Low at Main Time</B> to set the selected signal "low", and use
<B>Set Signal Undefined at Main Time</B> to set the selected signal "undefined" (X).
Use the <B>Get Information about Selected Signals</B> command to show stimuli and
other information on the selected signals.
<P>
Stimuli can be seen in the waveform window as large red boxes at the designated time.
To remove a stimulus, select the red box and use the <B>Clear Selected Stimuli</B> command.
To remove all stimuli on a the selected waveforms, use <B>Clear All Stimuli on Selected Signals</B>.
To remove all stimuli in the simulation, use <B>Clear All Stimuli</B>.
<P>
Once a set of stimuli has been established, you can save it to disk with the
<B>Save Stimuli to Disk...</B> command.
The saved file is an IRSIM "command file" which can be edited by hand.
These stimuli can be restored later with the <B>Restore Stimuli from Disk...</B> command.
<P>
Because the process of simulating a circuit can be costly, you can choose to resimulate
each time a stimulus is added, or you can choose to resimulate only when requested.
By default, the simulation is re-run each time any stimulus is changed.
By unchecking "Resimulate each change" in the "Simulators" preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Simulators" tab),
the simulation is not re-run with each stimulus change.
Instead, you must issue the <B>Update Simulation Window</B> command to re-run the simulation.

<TABLE><TR><TD>
Many other IRSIM options can be controlled with the "Simulators" preferences.
"Auto advance time" requests that the main time cursor advance after each stimulus is added.
This allows each stimulus added to occur at a new time.
"Multistate display" requests that strength information be displayed as well.
This strength information is not used in IRSIM, so the checkbox does not apply.
<P>
IRSIM uses a parameter file to describe timing and parasitic information.
Some of these files come packaged with Electric, but you can create your own and set it.
In addition to the parameter file, you can select the simulation model that IRSIM uses.
The default is a RC model, but a Linear model is also available.
<P>
Advanced users who edit their own command files may enter specialized IRSIM debugging
commands.
These commands depend on a set of flags to determine the type of debugging to do.
Checkboxes in the "IRSIM Debugging" section control these debugging flags.
<P>
The bottom section has two miscellaneous IRSIM controls.
"Show IRSIM commands" requests that the system display the command file instructions as they
are applied during simulation.
"Use Delayed X propagation" does XXXXX.

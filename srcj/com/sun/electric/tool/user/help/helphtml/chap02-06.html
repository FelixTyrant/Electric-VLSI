<!-- HEADER 2-6: Changing Orientation -->


There are two commands that can be used to change the orientation of a node.
The <B>Rotate</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu has a submenu that allows the currently highlighted objects to rotate in any of three Manhattan directions or by an arbitrary amount.
<P>
The <B>Mirror</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu has a submenu that allows you to flip the currently highlighted objects about their vertical or horizontal centerline.

Be aware that mirroring is not the same as rotating, even though both may produce the same visual results.
Mirroring causes the node to be rotated and <I>transposed</I>.
Transposition is a flip about the diagonal centerline.
A second mirroring removes the transposition of the node.
<P>
Electric stores orientation as a combination of rotation and transposition
(this can be seen in the <B>Get Info</B> dialog).
The diagram on the right illustrates the meaning of rotation and transposition.

<!-- HEADER 9-6-2: NCC Commands -->

<!-- COMMAND Tool/NCC/Schematic and Layout Views of Cell in Current Window -->
<!-- COMMAND Tool/NCC/Cells from Two Windows -->

<P>
To compare two cells, use these commands (in menu <B>Tool / NCC</B>):
<UL>
<LI>
   <B>Schematic and Layout Views of Cell in Current Window</B>

   Use a heuristic to figure out what to compare against the cell in
   the current window.  If the current cell is a schematic then
   compare it against some layout cell in the same cell group.  If the
   current cell is a layout then compare it against some schematic
   cell in the same cell group.  Since most cell groups have one
   layout cell and one schematic cell, this form of the NCC command is
   usually the most convenient.
</LI>
<LI>
   <B>Cells from two Windows</B>

   Compare the two cells that are displayed in the two opened windows
   (there must be exactly two windows). This is useful when the
   schematic and layout are not in the same cell group. The command
   can also be used to compare schematics with schematics or layout
   with layout. However, the command refuses to compare icon cells
   since icons cells don't have defined connectivity.

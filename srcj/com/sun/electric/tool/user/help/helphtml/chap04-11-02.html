<!-- PREFERENCE Display/3D -->

To control the 3D view,
use the "3D" preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Display" section, "3D" tab).
This provides access to the majority of the parameters that control the 3D view and its rendering.
Only colors assigned to 3D features are available in the "Colors" tab
(see <A HREF="chap04-06-01.html">Section 4-6-2</A>).

<P>
The most important 3D characteristics are the distance of the layer from the wafer bottom and its thickness.
These values are not only used for the 3D view; they use also for sorting algorithms in layers.
In the 3D preferences, thickness and Z distance of each layer can be modified as well as the view mode,
the scale along Z axis and control of antialiasing.
<P>
Two view modes are available: perspective (the default) and parallel.
Unselect "Use Perspective" 
to see a parallel display.
If available, antialiasing can be turned on by clicking on "Use Antialiasing".
Due to performance issues, antialiasing is not on by default.
If the displayed layers are too thin along the Z axis (compared to their X,Y values),
use the Z Scale field to make everything thicker.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
On the left side of this dialog is a list of layers in the current technology.
On the right side is a cross section view of the chip, showing which layers are above which others.
You can select a layer by clicking on either side of the dialog.
The currently selected layer is highlighted in the list on the left and shown in red in the right-hand view.
<P>
"3D HIGHLIGHTED INSTANCES" in the "Color" tab is the color to highlight layers in this tab
and nodes in the 3D view can be changed.

<P>
Once selected, <!--you can drag layers to the desired height (on the right side) or -->
you type a distance value (on the left side).
You can also set the thickness of a layer by typing a value into the field.

If the 3D plug-in is not available, the distance and the thickness are still available in the 3D Preferences
tab however the drawing is done with the Java2D API instead (see figure below).

<!-- HEADER 6-8-4: Text Defaults -->

To change the default size and grab-point of all new text,
use the "Text" tab of the "Display" section of the <B>Preferences...</B> command of the <B>File</B> menu.
The top part of the dialog determines which types of text will be affected.
The middle part lets you control how that type of text will appear in the future.
You can set the size, anchor-point, font, and style.
Below that section is a popup that sets the default font for Electric.

The bottom part of the dialog controls "smart placement" of text,
which adjusts the grab point according to the environment of the text.
This currently applies only to export names,
which are placed relative to the arc connecting to the exported node.
For example, if a node on the left end of a wire is has an export,
and the "Horizontal" placement is set to "Inside",
then the export text will attach on the left side, causing the label to appear inside of the wire.

<!-- HEADER 6-8-4: Text Defaults -->

To change the default size and grab-point of all new text,
use the <B>Text Options...</B> command of the <B>Window</B> menu.
The top part of the dialog lets you set the default size, face,
and style of text that will appear in
different locations (on cell instances, on nonlayout text,
on exports, on nodes, and on arcs).
Nonlayout text is the freestanding text that is created with the <B>Text (nonlayout)</B>
subcommand of the <B>New Special Object</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.

The center section of the dialog has two unrelated controls.
The field labeled "Text editor"
allows you to choose which style of text editing to use when working with large amounts of text
(see <A HREF="chap04-10.html#chap04-10">Section 4-10</A> for more on text windows).
The "New text visible only inside cell"
checkbox requests that nonlayout text objects be drawn only when inside of the cell,
and not when instances of the cell are expanded.

<P>
The lower-left part of the dialog lets you set the grab-point of subsequently created text.
The lower-right part of the dialog controls "smart placement" of text,
which adjusts the grab point according to the environment of the text.
This currently applies only to export names,
which are placed relative to the arc connecting to the exported node.
For example, if a node on the left end of a wire is has an export,
and the "Smart Horizontal Placement" is set to "Inside",
then the export text will attach on the left side, causing the label to appear inside of the wire.

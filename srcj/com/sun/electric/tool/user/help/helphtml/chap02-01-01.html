<!-- HEADER 2-1-1: Selecting Nodes and Arcs -->

<!-- COMMAND Edit/Selection/Select Object... -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Selection/Deselect All Arcs -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Selection/Select All Like This -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Selection/Select All -->

Electric is a <I>noun/verb</I> system, meaning that all commands work by first selecting something (the noun)
and then doing an operation (the verb).
For this reason, selection is important.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Selection (and movement) are done in "selection" mode, which is the default mode when the selection icon is selected.

<P>
Selection is done with clicks of the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">left</A></I> button.
Individual nodes and arcs are selected by clicking over them.
Once selected, they are highlighted on the screen.
If you use the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">shift-left</A></I> button, unhighlighted nodes
and arcs are added to the selection, but objects that are already highlighted become deselected.
<P>
There are often multiple objects under the cursor (for example, in the area where an arc overlaps a node).
To get the object you want, hold the control key while clicking.
The <I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">control-left</A></I> button cycles through all objects under the cursor.
<P>
The notion of toggling selection (shift-left) and cycling through what is under the cursor (control-left)
can be combined.
If there are multiple objects under the cursor,
 and you are trying to toggle the selection,
use the <I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">control-shift-left</A></I> button to cycle through them
.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
To select an object by its name, use the <B>Select Object...</B> subcommand of the <B>Selection</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
The resulting dialog lets you select nodes, arcs, exports, or networks in the cell.
</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig02-14.png" ALT="Figure 2.14"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
To select everything in the cell,
use the <B>Select All</B> subcommand of the <B>Selection</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
To deselect everything, use <B>Select Nothing</B>.
<P>
To select everything in the cell that is the same as the currently selected objects,
use the <B>Select All Like This</B> subcommand of the <B>Selection</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.

The <B>Deselect All Arcs</B> command deselects all selected arcs.
This is useful when you wish to select a set of nodes,
but you have selected the entire area, including nodes and arcs.

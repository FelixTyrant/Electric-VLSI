<!-- HEADER 2-1-1: Selecting Nodes and Arcs -->

Electric is a <I>noun/verb</I> system, meaning that all commands work by first selecting something (the noun)
and then doing an operation (the verb).
For this reason, selection is important.
<P>
Selection is done with clicks of the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:left  Windows:left  Mac:click">selection</A></I> button
(this is typically just the left button).
Individual nodes and arcs are selected by clicking over them.
Once selected, they are highlighted on the screen.
If you use the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:shift-left  Windows:shift-left  Mac:shift-click">toggle select</A></I> button
(typically the same as the <I>selection</I> button but with the shift key held), unhighlighted nodes
and arcs are added to the selection, but objects that are already highlighted become deselected.
<P>
If there are multiple objects under the cursor,
use the <I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:ctrl-left  Windows:ctrl-left  Mac:ctrl-click">select another</A></I> button to cycle through them
(this is typically the same as the <I>selection</I> button but with the control key held).
If there are multiple objects under the cursor,
and you are trying to do a <I>toggle select</I> to add to the selection,
then use the <I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:shift-ctrl-left  Windows:shift-ctrl-left  Mac:shift-ctrl-click">toggle select another</A></I> button to cycle through them
(this is typically the same as the <I>selection</I> button but with the control and shift keys held).
<P>
To select an object by its name, use the subcommands of the <B>Selection</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
The <B>Select Node...</B> subcommand selects a node by name, <B>Select Arc...</B> selects an arc by name,
<B>Select Network...</B> selects a network by name, and <B>Select Export...</B> selects an export by name.
You can also use the Cell Explorer to select from a list of objects
(see <A HREF="chap03-07.html#chap03-07">Section 3-7</A>).
<P>
To select everything in the cell,
use the <B>Select All</B> subcommand of the <B>Selection</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
To select everything in the cell that is the same as the currently selected objects,
use the <B>Select All Like This</B> subcommand of the <B>Selection</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.

This text is a draft suggests definition of the Technology Xml syntax for future Electric
release version8-07 .

The syntax is being protyped by
com/sun/electric/technology/xml/Technology807.xsd - syntax of Xml language
com/sun/electric/technology/xml/Xml807.xsd - reader/writer of Xml language
com/sun/electric/technology/technologies/mocmos807.xml - an example in this syntax
but currently they are not at final syntax.

Technology description will be in symbolic form, where distances are expressed
by Xml construct Distance.
Distance is a linear expression which is a sum of terms.
There is an arbitrary number of variable terms and an optional constant term.

<xsd:group name="Distance">
    <xsd:sequence>
        <xsd:element name="rule" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">
            <xsd:complexType>
                <xsd:attribute name="ruleName" type="tns:RuleName" use="required"/>
                <xsd:attribute name="layer" type="tns:LayerName">
                <xsd:attribute name="layer2" type="tns:LayerName">
                <xsd:attribute name="k" type="xsd:double"/>
            </xsd:complexType>
        </xsd:element>
        <xsd:element name="lambda" type="xsd:double" minOccurs="0"></xsd:element>
    </xsd:sequence>
</xsd:group>

The constanct term is a double in lambda units.
The variable term is a name of variable and constant double multiplier "k".
Name of variable is either simple name "ruleName" or
"ruleName" indexed by one or two layers.

The examples of terms are
<rule ruleName="width" layer="P-Active" k="0.5"/>
<rule ruleName="overhang" layer="P-Select" layer2="P-Active">
<lambda>3.0</lambda>


A construct to define values of rule indexed by layer is 
<layerRule>. It has ruleName and a map from layers to Distance expressions.
For example:
<layerRule ruleName="width">
  <layer name="Metal-1>  <rule ruleName="7.1"/></layer>
  <layer name="Metal-2>  <rule ruleName="9.1"/></layer>
</layerRule>

There will be a section in <foundry> which defines foundry specific rules like this

<Foundry name="SUBM">
  <ruleDef ruleName="7.1" value="3.0"/>
</Foundry>

---------------------------
Some layer rules are used implicitly. They are:

<rule name="width" layer="layerName"/>   used as default width of pure layer nodes
<rule name="thick3d" layer="layerName"/>   used in Display3D and (possibly) in parasitics extraction
<rule name="height3d" layer="layerName"/>   used in Display3D and (possibly) in parasitics extraction

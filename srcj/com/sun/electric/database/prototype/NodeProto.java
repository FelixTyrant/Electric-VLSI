/**
 * The NodeProto interface defines a type of NodeInst.
 * It can be implemented as PrimitiveNode (for primitives from Technologies)
 * or as Cell (for cells in Libraries).
 * <P>
 * Every node in the database appears as one <I>prototypical</I> object and many <I>instantiative</I> objects.
 * Thus, for a PrimitiveNode such as the CMOS P-transistor there is one object (called a PrimitiveNode, which is a NodeProto)
 * that describes the transistor prototype and there are many objects (called NodeInsts),
 * one for every instance of a transistor that appears in a circuit.
 * Similarly, for every Cell, there is one object (called a Cell, which is a NodeProto)
 * that describes the Cell with everything in it and there are many objects (also called NodeInsts)
 * for every use of that Cell in some other Cell.
 * PrimitiveNodes are statically created and placed in the Technology objects,
 * but complex Cells are created by the tools and placed in Library objects.
 * <P>
 * The basic NodeProto has a list of varibales, a list of ports, the bounds and much more.
